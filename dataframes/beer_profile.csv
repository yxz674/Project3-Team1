252,Double Bag,Altbier,7.2,3.9,37.5,"Notes:This malty, full-bodied double alt is also known as “Stickebier” – German slang for “secret brew”. Long Trail Double Bag was originally offered only in our brewery taproom as a special treat to our visitors. With an alcohol content of 7.2%, please indulge in moderation. The Long Trail Brewing Company is proud to have Double Bag named Malt Advocate’s “Beer of the Year” in 2001. Malt Advocate is a national magazine devoted to “expanding the boundaries of fine drinks”. Their panel of judges likes to keep things simple, and therefore of thousands of eligible competitors they award only two categories: “Imported” and “Domestic”. It is a great honor to receive this recognition.33 IBU	"
253,Long Trail Ale,Altbier,5.0,3.58,37.5,"Notes:Long Trail Ale is a full-bodied amber ale modeled after the “Alt-biers” of Düsseldorf, Germany. Our top fermenting yeast and cold finishing temperature result in a complex, yet clean, full flavor. Originally introduced in November of 1989, Long Trail Ale beer quickly became, and remains, the largest selling craft-brew in Vermont. It is a multiple medal winner at the Great American Beer Festival.25 IBU	"

255,Scurry,Altbier,5.3,3.67,37.5,"Notes:Just cause it's dark and German doesn't mean it's an alt. Based on the obscure Kottbusser style of beer, this surprisingly dry beer retains all the aroma and nuance of honey (from bees) and molasses (not from bees) creating a perception of sweetness through cool, controlled fermentation. Because we're sweet enough damn it. 18 IBU	"
256,Sleigh'r Dark Doüble Alt Ale,Altbier,7.2,3.78,37.5,"Notes:Called 'Dark Double Alt' on the label.Seize the season with Sleigh'r. Layers of deeply toasted malt are balanced by just enough hop bitterness to make it deceivingly drinkable. Paired with a dry finish, Sleigh’r is anything but your typical winter brew.An Alt ferments with Ale yeast at colder lagering temperatures. This effect gives Alts a more refined, crisp lager-like flavor than traditional ales. The Alt has been “Ninkasified” raising the ABV and IBUs. Sleigh'r has a deep, toasted malt flavor that finishes dry and balanced.50 IBU	"

262,Altbier,Altbier,4.7,4.0,37.5,"Notes:Uerige Alt is the most bittered beer in Germany. In spite of this (or just for that reason), this legendary Altbier from Düsseldorf is so full-bodied, aromatic and wholesome.Our top-fermented specialty has been brewed since 1862 from barley malt, caramel malt, roasted malt, hops, water - and with our very special Uerige yeast.Our Uerige Alt is regularly chosen among the ten best beers in Germany.

263,Gerst Amber,Altbier,5.1,3.54,37.5,"Notes:Check out a piece of Nashville brewing history! Gerst Brewery was the original Nashville brewery, but never recovered after prohibition. We are excited to partner with the Chandler Family, owners of the Gerst Haus Restaurant, to bring this beer back right where it belongs – Nashville, Tennessee.This is a very “clean” beer, with mostly German malts and a hint of flaked maize, remaining as true as possible to the original Gerst recipe.11 IBUs	"
264,Ad Astra Ale,Altbier,5.6,3.69,37.5,"Notes:This ale is the first brewed in Kansas since pioneering days. The name ""Ad Astra comes from the Kansas State Motto - Ad Astra per Aspera, Latin words meaning ""To the Stars through Difficulties"". We've blended Pale, Caramel, and Munich malts for a rich amber beer. The hops balance this malty sweetness, and we've chosen Northern brewer and Fuggles hops for their flavor.24 IBU	"
265,Doppel Sticky,Altbier,7.7,4.07,37.5,"Notes:This fruity, estery double altbier is brewed in the traditional-ish style of the Doppelsticke, which is the widely known secret Germanic-esque strong ale. Like it's California Common counterpart, we fermented this ale at a lower temperature to pull out the sulphur-y bite from the yeast, then dry-hopped it with some dank, Sticky hops, including some brand-spankin'-new Enigma hops from the great Down Under! 66 IBUs	"
266,Copperhead Ale,Altbier,5.2,3.37,37.5,Notes:The name isn’t a coincidence. This Düsseldorf style Altbier blends caramelized malted barley with pronounced hop character to create a subtle copper hue. Copperhead Ale is famous for its signature balanced flavor & impeccable smoothness.

268,Three Blind Mice,Altbier,5.5,3.57,37.5,"Notes:Three Blind Mice is inspired by our favorite qualities from English brown ales, German altbiers, and Irish reds. Mother’s trio of beer connoisseurs sipped away many a night, working to find this ideal combination. Mother’s beautiful brown beer is medium-bodied with caramel, toffee, and subtle chocolate malt flavors—all balanced by moderate hop notes and a clean, dry finish.Three Blind Mice combines components of several malty beers for the unique brown beer experience you've been missing. After lots of research to find the perfect styles for our base, the clear winners were the lighter body and caramel characters of Irish red ales, the soft chocolate and toffee flavors from English brown ales, and the hop component and balance of German altbiers. We used traditional elements from each beer style and added our own touch for one incredible brown beer.24 IBU	"
269,Ishmael,Altbier,4.9,3.71,37.5,"Notes:Ishmael is our richly-flavored American copper ale. This American interpretation of the altbiers of Düsseldorf is brewed with continental Munich malt, American-grown hops, and a clean-fermenting ale yeast to produce a slightly sweet and malty beer balanced by a firm bitterness.	"
270,Headwall Alt,Altbier,4.5,3.69,37.5,"Notes:This is traditional style of altbeir from Düsseldorf, Germany. Alt literally means old in German. Staying as true to the recipe as possible, the Headwall Alt is brewed using German malts, plus German and American hops. Like the Pale Ale, the Headwall Alt is cold conditioned, dry-hopped and krausened in the bottle or keg. Similar to the Pale Ale, the process takes about 30 days.	"

286,Gravel Road,Altbier,7.25,3.54,37.5,Notes:
287,Little Red Cap,Altbier,5.2,3.63,37.5,"Notes:Altbier is German for “Old Beer”, this refers to the “old” style of brewing using an ale yeast (As opposed to a lager yeast fermentation which is a relatively new process). This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup. "
288,Festivale,Altbier,4.7,3.69,37.5,"Notes:Festivale is an amber ale, with balanced high-intensity maltiness and hop presence. Caramunich malts give Festivale its colour and a rich caramel sweetness. Festivale bucks the trend of pale summer beers, offering up amber hues and tastiness for a unique result that is both quaffable and refreshing.40 IBU	"

291,Scruffy's Smoked Alt,Altbier,5.1,3.68,37.5,"Notes:Our goal is to have a very drinkable beer with a nice smoked quality that will pair well with food and be something a little different. We blend a good amount of German Rauch malt, that is smoked with beachwood, with a US two-row malt, Crystal 40, Crystal 120 and a bit of Pale Chocolate Malt. We use enough US Magnum & Willamette hops to balance the malty sweetness of the German Alt yeast used to ferment the beer. That leaves moderately smokey notes that comes through mostly in the flavor that is balanced with the slight fruity flavor that the Alt yeast will give you. A very session-able smoked ale with enough bitterness to balance the other flavors.	"
292,Über Alt,Altbier,8.5,3.96,37.5,"Notes:Our Alt is a much stronger version of the traditional Dusseldorf Altbiers. An ancient style from the Rhineland, Altbiers are ales that were virtually wiped out by German lagers in the 1800’s. We use plenty of European hops and German pilsner malts to brew a remarkably clean beer. We then rest it in the cooler for two months to achieve the mellow finish that is the Überalt’s trademark.	"

298,GPA (German Pale Ale),Altbier,5.2,3.82,37.5,"Notes:A German style pale ale debatably does not exist in the craft beer industry. Until now. 3 Nations’ German Pale Ale (GPA) is our experiment turned calling card. We couldn’t be more proud of the way this beer’s enormous citrus, passion fruit, and lemony like aromas blend with a bitterness that gives it a recognizable finish. Plus, the well-rounded malt profile balances out the American hops. That’s right, we used American hops to brew this cross of a German Alt/Koelsch. It’s not blasphemy. Just a revised version of a traditional style, with a little greatness mixed in.	"

First introduced in the winter of 1983, Bigfoot is a cult-classic beer brewed in the barleywine style, meaning a strong, robust, bruiser of a beer with the refined intensity of a wine. Bigfoot is prized by beer collectors for its supreme cellarability. Under the proper conditions, it can age like a fine wine, developing new flavors and character as it matures in the bottle.

4215,Helldorado,Barleywine - American,12.8,4.29,80.0,"Notes:Part of the adventure of aging beer in retired spirits barrels is the synergistic interaction of different malt flavors with the oak and spirit flavors from the barrel. Darker beers like stouts and darker barley wines have typically been the favored candidates for barrel-aging, due to their deeper caramel and roasted flavors. Helldorado breaks that mold with a deep golden color from being brewed solely with English and American pale malts. The bready, honeyed flavors of pale malts pull out rich wildflower honey, vanilla and coconut notes from the oak, creating an overall flavor evocative of bourbon-glazed graham crackers that stands as singularly unique in our Vintage lineup.

The American version has been blown up with more alcohol, larger bottles and more hops.Smuttynose Barleywine straddles these two branches of the barleywine tree. When you taste it, you’ll notice deep, rich caramel malt flavors, balanced with hop bitterness. Fruity hop flavors act as a garnish for its amped-up but classic flavor. For a more refined experience, tuck a few bottles away for a year or two.

4240,Chicken Killer Barley Wine,Barleywine - American,10.0,3.72,80.0,"Notes:Chicken Killer Barley Wine is the revolutionary beer that will someday define America's unique Barley Wine style. It is brewed with twice the ingredients of the Santa Fe Brewing Company's other beers, and only half the usual amount of liquid is extracted from these ingredients. This makes one substantial beer. At over ten percent alcohol, Chicken Killer is actually as substantial as wine, but this is not to say that it is difficult to drink. On the contrary; be careful with this one. The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city. If you did not have the opportunity to try last year's vintage, come try this year's!	"

1674,Old Man,Bitter - English Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.4,3.89,30.0,"Notes:Our classic English-style Bitter returns to pay homage to a great man and an integral part of the Tree House team - Nate’s father, Dan! Dan has been spent his work-tirement assisting Tree House on the canning line and in many other ways both physically and spiritually. This beer is an homage and a thanks to a great man - and more broadly to fathers everywhere. Thanks, ‘Da’.Don’t be fooled by the name - our interpretation of an Extra Special Bitter carries light bitterness and a gentle earthy noble hop character from Fuggles hops. The hops are balanced by an airy fruitiness and a rich base of flavors evoking caramel malts, brown sugar, and hazelnut. It is a wonderful and simple beer we find best paired with fish and chips, smoked meat, roasted chicken or, ideally, a day on the river.	"
1675,Winter ESB,Bitter - English Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.8,3.8,30.0,"Notes:Our Winter ESB (Extra Special Bitter) may have the word “bitter” in its name, but the key to this style is balance. The combination of malts and hops creates a toasty, fruity flavor. Our ESB is dry hopped with a US grown hop varietal called Williamette, which has a pronounced spicy, lemon flavor.In the early 1970’s, brewers in London and the south of England expanded the range of beers available in pubs, reacting to the wave of European lagers moving into the British pub scene. In addition to the ordinary bitters and pale ales, brewers developed recipes for stronger premium ales like ESB, special bitter and special pale ale. These beers contributed to the English traditional ale revival of the 1980’s, making their way into the beer portfolios of many American craft breweries.30 IBU	"

Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It’s always been a simple life — the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion.	"

Golden multifaceted Belgian style ale with subtle fruity notes of apricot, lychee, currant, and honey layered with noble hop spice and peppercorn phenol notes.	"

1,Ayinger Celebrator,Bock - Doppelbock,6.7,4.37,22.0,"Notes:A beer that has a dominant malty taste. This beer’s origins in a monk’s recipe are reflected in its heartiness. The Pope of Beers, Conrad Seidl, describes it as: “Almost black with a very slight red tone, a sensational, festive foam and truly extraordinary fragrance that at first summons up visions of greaves lard. The first taste is of mild fullness with an accompanying coffee tone, which becomes more dominant with the aftertaste. There is very little of the sweetness that is frequently to be tasted with doppelbock beer.” The Ayinger Celebrator has been ranked among the best beers of the world by the Chicago Testing Institute several times and has won numerous medals.

As solid as a rock, Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel presides over the evening meal with a colour reminiscent of dark copper with nuances of fiery red. Its clear gleaming look harmonises with its firm, fine pored head.Also the aroma delights the connoisseur: soft roasted accents and a nuance of dried fruit carrying a vein of caramel. This Doppelbock Dunkel from Bavaria’s Holy Mountain presents a pleasant effervescence. And then there’s the unmistakable flavour: mouthcoating and velvety, strong and yet pleasantly malty – a powerful, robust body. At the same time, it develops an easily recognisable sweetness, embraced in roasted cocoa and a light, bitter hoppiness.Concluding with a powerful punch, this Doppelbock departs with a lingering aftertaste of quality plain chocolate. A strong Doppelbock that embodies the centuries old Benedictine brewing tradition, sip by delicious sip.	"

This German lager beer is rich and malty and brewed to an alcohol strength of 6-7%. “Ice Bock” is produced when a Bock beer is partially frozen in order to increase it’s alcohol content. In this process, some of the water content turns to ice, effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing, the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time. The resulting beer is a deceptively smooth and amazingly strong lager.	"

After benumbing a thick and malty doppelbock for days, we mined the resulting colossal chunks of ice from the vat to extract the pesky water obstructing the full potential of this deliciously decadent libation. Its thick and creamy mouthfeel is interlaced with a prevalent chocolaty richness that seductively satiates.

144,Brinkley's Maibock,Bock - Maibock,6.5,3.6,29.0,"Notes:This beer has a very full and complex flavor that is best enjoyed slowly, allowing the different flavors time to develop on your tongue. You will find that it changes as you progress from the first taste to the lingering finish. The malty sweetness is well balanced and blended with hop bitterness, giving a full, rich blend of flavors. A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau.The traditional symbol for bock beers of all varieties is the billy goat. This is the reason that Free State named this Maibock after Dr. John R. Brinkley, a.k.a. ""The Goat Gland Doctor.""

This means we stuffed as many full-cone hops – fresh from the fields – as we could into a lager tank and filled the rest of the space with our bock beer. The beer was then left to mature for two months before it was once again enriched with hop oils.To preserve all the wonderful flavors developed during the process, this beer goes directly into bottles without filtration.Light-golden in color with a mild cloudiness, our Saphir-Bock shimmers tantalizingly in the glass. The floral hop aromas harmonize perfectly with the warm ester notes. When taken to the nose, you may make out hints of mandarin, lychee, and ripe pears. On the tongue, you'll immediately be struck by the full-bodiedness. As it moves back across the palate, the hop notes open up, revealing themselves in all their glory in the finish. The pleasant fruity-bitterness travels up the throat, across the palate, and into the nose, where it is greeted, once again, by the sweet ester notes of the yeast.This constant play between full-bodied maltiness and floral hoppiness ensures an unforgettable drinking experience.

We brew this 8.5% ABV holiday offering with orange blossom honey, malted wheat and dark Munich malt, a hint of Chocolate malt, and German Hallertau and Tettnanger hops. While most German bock beers named with the ‘-or’ ending are traditional double bock lagers, we decided to break from tradition a bit with not only the name of this beer, but the use of orange blossom honey as well. Prost!	"

This top-fermented, unfiltered Wheat Bock beer is the counterpart to Bayern’s famous Doppelbock Lager and is decoction-brewed, a technique used often in Bavaria but seldom in the US. The recipe uses five types of malt (Wheat, Pilsener, Carmel, Munich and Chocolate), and has an o.g. of > 17 % Plato, producing a stout 7.5 % Alc. by Vol. As with all Bayern wheat beers, Face Plant surprises with its complex flavor. German Hallertauer Perle hops give this hearty Bock beer a perfectly balanced sweetness.	"

It is a classic, top-fermented, golden yellow strong beer, which is fermented traditionally in the bottle. The foam is particularly fine-pored, very stable and creamy. In appearance, one finds a strong golden-yellow color with beautiful, natural haziness. The smell is fruity, with a trace of banana flavor. In the first sip, this beer specialty is balanced, full-bodied, sparkling and rounded - the malt character is balanced and aromatic. In the aftertaste, it is very mild and makes you want another sip, especially so on cold winter days.	"

We simply use pale malt and a very small amount of Target hops in this Belgian style ale. The bulk of the body, color and sweetness come from the 2,000 lbs. of honey we add to the boil.The Brother is cellared for up to a year before it is bottled, which helps to marry the flavors and create the complex palate in this Bragget.

5101,Sanctification,Brett Beer,4.8,4.34,0.0,"Notes:Who’s afraid of the ""big bad BRETT?"" We’ll tell you who: winemakers! Because of our close proximity to several hundred wineries, we often get winemakers visiting our brewery. (After all, it takes a lot of great beer to make great wine!) Because we use 100% Brettanomyces yeast to ferment Sanctification, most winemakers will only smell the glass, and only a very few will venture to taste the beer. They think the Brettanomyces will attach to their clothing and end up in their winery. A simple solution was offered: keep a smudge pot burning at the door of our brewery so they can burn their clothes when exiting, but even that was not enough. After giving it more thought, we concluded that winemakers think Brettanomyces might scar their taste buds and possible even permeate their skin? Either way, Sanctification is one of the most unique beers you will ever taste! It was fermented with 100% Brettanomyces, rather than the traditional Saccharomyces.	"

But add a touch of brettanomyces, the unruly beast responsible for the sharp tang and deep funk found in many Belgian ales, and our WildDevil emerges completely untamed. Floral, aromatic hops still leap from this amber ale, as a host of new fermentation flavor kicks up notes of citrus and pine. Pour yourself a glass today—if you dare.	"

The various spirit barrels bring on a new life to this beer as it conditions for months, while obtaining additional bourbon and whiskey characteristics. Dominated by dark fruit aromas and flavors, the underlying cacao notes meld with an acidic tart berry finish. With each batch release being a unique blend of barrels, the multiple variations of Nightmare on Brett released throughout the year prove that with creativity and experimentation, anything is possible.

The operative words in our beer-cellaring thesis are ""over time."" For those of you who are impatient or like to experiment, the earliest we recommend sampling this beer is one year before the date on the label. The beer won't be fully carbonated until that date. Ideally, you'll want to cellar the beer up to—or beyond—the Enjoy After date to help it reach its full evolutionary potential. At that point, some facets of the Brett characteristics will have mellowed, while others will have become more profound; it all matures into a fascinating and delicious culmination. Individual results will vary...and that's both the beauty and the intent behind this beer.	"

5125,Brett IPA,Brett Beer,7.1,4.12,0.0,"Notes:During transport overseas, early India Pale Ales were stored in wooden barrels. In these barrels—beer experts suppose—some ales were naturally inoculated with Brettanomyces, a form of wild yeast. Brett IPA plays off this piece of brewing lore by pairing Brettanomyces—a yeast that exhibits itself as ripe fruit rather than strong funk or sourness—with multiple varieties of fruit-forward hops.Aromas of citrus, pineapple, and passion fruit meld into tropical flavors that pair nicely with the beer’s lightly hopped body. Maris Otter, Munich malts, and raw wheat balance the floral barrage of Bravo, Cascade, Amarillo, Centennial, Citra, and Galaxy hops. By finishing with a mix of pleasant bitterness and tropical fruit, Brett IPA ushers brewing history into the present.	"

Yet another Barrelworks creation with DBA roots, this beer begins as Double DBA and is selectively matured in bourbon barrels for several months. A further 18 months of secondary fermentation and additional maturation in French and American oak barrels creates unparalleled depth and complexity. This hefty brew is brimming with a full spectrum of flavors and aromas: Nutty sherry aromas mingle with Oak, then give way to a Cointreau-like boozy orange zest. Tart cherries linger as the acidity builds on the palate. Vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon provide a supporting cast. The whole experience is reminiscent of a Manhattan cocktail.

A cross between a Scotch Ale, an India Pale Ale and an American Brown, Indian Brown Ale is well-hopped and malty at the same time (It's magical!).The beer has characteristics of each style that inspired it: the color of an American Brown, the caramel notes of a Scotch Ale, and the hopping regiment of an India Pale Ale. We dry-hop the Indian Brown Ale in a similar fashion to our 60 Minute IPA and 90 Minute IPA. This beer is brewed with Aromatic barley and organic brown sugar.50 IBU	"

Layered with notes of chocolate and toasted bread and a hint of smoke, Tumbler is the ultimate autumn beer, so grab a seat and watch as the leaves come tumbling down.2014 - Available in Fall Variety Pack (no longer available standalone)	"
305,Best Brown Ale,Brown Ale - American,5.8,3.85,35.0,"Notes:A smooth, toasty brown ale, Best Brown is a mainstay in our fall lineup. With hints of caramel and cocoa, the malt body has the depth to stand up to cool weather, but does not come across as heavy. This balancing act is aided by the generous use of American hops.	"
306,Moose Drool Brown Ale,Brown Ale - American,5.1,3.72,35.0,"Notes:It's chocolate brown in color with a creamy texture. A malty beer with just enough hop presence to keep it from being too sweet. The aroma mostly comes from the malt with a hint of spice added by the hops. Moose Drool is brewed with pale, caramel, chocolate, and whole black malts; and Kent Goldings, Liberty, and Willamette hops.	"

310,Brown Ale,Brown Ale - American,5.6,3.65,35.0,"Notes:This is the award-winning original American brown ale, first brewed as a holiday specialty, and now one of our most popular beers year-round. Northern English brown ales tend to be strong and dry, while southern English brown ales are milder and sweeter. Brooklyn Brown Ale combines the best of those classic styles and then adds an American accent in the form of a firm hop character and roasty palate. A blend of six malts, some of them roasted, give this beer its deep russet-brown color and complex malt flavor, fruity, smooth and rich, with a caramel, chocolate and coffee background. Generous late hopping brings forward a nice hop aroma to complete the picture. Brooklyn Brown Ale is full-flavored but retains a smoothness and easy drinkability that has made it one of the most popular dark beers in the Northeast.	"

An easy-drinking ale with many layers of satisfaction.	"
313,Sumatra Mountain Brown,Brown Ale - American,9.0,4.3,35.0,"Notes:This bold, imperial brown ale gets its body from a team of malts including Caramel malt for sweetness, flaked barley for dense foam, a bit of Chocolate malt for its deep color and Aromatic and Munich malts to add even more depth. German and Perle hops add a touch of bitterness to balance the malty sweetness. The addition of rich Sumatra coffee takes this perfectly balanced imperial brown ale to a decadent level.	"

Full-flavored with notes of sweet caramel, chocolate, and toasted malt, Bellaire Brown is balanced with a mild and earthy hop quality. This ale is dark and rich with a medium body. It’s hardly classifiable as a brown, but is certainly considered a delicious masterpiece.Bellaire Brown was originally created to appeal to people who enjoyed drinking coffee, and to beer drinkers who are not interested in hoppy options. When Joe Short was creating the Bellaire Brown recipe, he desired a beer that was meatier and burlier than most browns. Bellaire Brown is a great gate-way beer for drinkers to be introduced to darker beer varieties.19 IBU	"

As per the analysis, Dogfish Head's Theobroma (translated into ""food of the gods"") is brewed with Aztec cocoa powder and cocoa nibs (from our friends at Askinosie Chocolate), honey, chilies and annatto (fragrant tree seeds).It's light in color, not what you expect from your typical chocolate beer (not that you'd be surpised that we'd do something unexpected with this beer!).8 IBU	"

1206,Regular Coffee,Cream Ale,12.0,4.26,16.0,"Notes:A Classic Jersey-ism is ""regular coffee."" Here when you oder a ""regular coffee"" at any place you trust to make a pork roll and cheese you get a paper cup of coffee with ""milk and 2 sugars"" rather than a ""black coffee that hasn't had the caffeine removed."" Acidic bitter coffee flattened by milk and sweetened; the perfect foil for the salty unctuous savor of breakfast on a roll. For our homage to Jersey's breakfast beverage, we teamed up with our neighbors at Fair Mountain Coffee Roasters looking for an elevated version of classic crappy coffee. We chose Mexican Chiapas for its bitterness akin to artichoke, roasting it a little darker than usual, along with Ethiopian Sidamo for its pleasant lemon-like acidity, which we pushed up through fermentation. We added this coffee blend to a high gravity golden cream ale, contributing our ""milk and 2 sugars."" Drink Regular Coffee because running over a black beer with coffee is no way to get to work.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AtZGKBsd94&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg "

Barrier and Carton took a classic cream ale version of the Need A Bigger Boat recipe to Smutt Labs. We swapped American 6 row in for the base malt, fermented cold with both beer’s common Kolsch yeast, held it cold for a while, then dry-hopped it within an inch of its life with Money’s hops.

You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish.	"

1816,Reposé,Farmhouse Ale - Bière de Garde,8.3,4.23,25.0,"Notes:The inspiration for Reposé came from dusty, hay-filled barns like the one near Jester King where we store our aged hops. We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Reposé was Bière de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bière de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Reposé was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015. The wort for Reposé was brewed with Texas Hill Country water from our well, malted barley, hay, aged hops, and fresh hops. It was then pitched with Jester King’s unique mixed culture of brewer’s yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. After an initial fermentation in stainless steel, Reposé was then slowly fermented for months in Brandy barrels we received from France. It is 8.3% alcohol by volume, 12 IBU, has a finishing gravity of 1.004, and was 3.25 pH at the time of bottling. The label art is by Jester King’s Josh Cockrell.	"

The beer is fermented with a distinct French farmhouse ale strain, then bottle conditioned with extra sugar and yeast for at least two weeks.Bière de Garde translates to “beer which has been kept or stored”. This traditional, artisan farmhouse ale from Northern France was brewed in early spring and stored in cold cellars for consumption in warmer months.

Hand-crafted by Ron Jeffries at his Jolly Pumpkin Brewery in Dexter, which is consistantly rated as one of one of the best in the world, all of the Leelanau Brewing Company beers are distingushed by their time spent in a large French oak barrique prior to bottling and re-fermentation. The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles.Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% abv, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don’t mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste. The slightly malty, fruity body quickly transitions effortlessly to a crisp, dry and somewhat tart finish. Signature hints of French oak and the complex yeast character place this all-natural beer among the best saisons, stock ales, and farmhouse styles of Michigan, France & Belgium.	"

When they ran out of beer they still didn't want to go outside so they decided it would be better if they just started brewing their beer in the sauna.

3253,Sahati,Farmhouse Ale - Sahti,10.5,4.3,0.0,"Notes:SAHATI is our interpretation of traditional Finnish sahti. Starting with a 200-year old Engelmann spruce tree felled on brewery property, we created our own kuurna (an ancient Scandinavian lauter tun) to separate the wort from the grain during brewing. The bottom of the kuurna is layered with spruce branches; the needles act as a natural filter and impart resinous oils into the wort. The hollowed-out trunk of the tree also contributes spruce essence and structure from the raw wood. The beer is made of barley & rye malts along with a sparing addition of Goschie Farms Cascade hops and is brewed just a few times per year. SAHATI is in many ways the very definition of The Ale Apothecary, where complex flavors arrive from the very methods used for production…the result is the process impacts the flavor profile at least as much as the ingredients themselves.

Here at Boulevard we have fermenter number seven, the black sheep of our cellar family. Ironically, when our brewers were experimenting with variations on a traditional Belgian-style farmhouse ale, the perfect combination of elements came together in that very vessel. You could call it fate, but they called it Tank 7, and so it is. Beginning with a big surge of fruity aromatics and grapefruit-hoppy notes, the flavor of this complex, straw-colored ale tapers off to a peppery, dry finish.38 IBU	"

Since 1844, this beer has been brewed in our farm-brewery, during the winter time. Then this beer became a second refermentation in the barrel. During the next summer, this very thirst-quenching beer was served to the “saisoniers” which were working on the fields. Surely therefore, our Saison Dupont is considered as “the classic” among the Belgian season beers!Coppery blond, the finest aromas and a strong bitterness transform this beer into a thirst-quenchener with no equal, just the way it was created. Our selection of yeasts is the perfect base for these typical aromas and ditto taste. A real refermentation in the bottle, which will continue for a long time in your cellar, result into this complex and particular aromatic beer.	"

With age, this beer will dry out and will become more complex with rustic notes of leather and earth from the contribution of a wild yeast strain.

1875,Cellar Door,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.6,4.04,29.0,"Notes:Over the ages the term ’cellar door’ has numerously been referred to as the most beautiful term in the English language. Upon setting out to create the first summer addition to the Stateside line up of ales; the feeling that almost instantly came to me was that of beauty & cleansing. Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment. Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the ’cleansing’ aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course let’s not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish.	"

To our delight, it spat out the sweet scent of juicy fruit wafting from a frothy, white mane. Brewed only with grain and sugar unencumbered by the heat of the kiln, we create a hazy, golden body.

Using time-honored techniques, our saisons employ traditional methods to restore complexity and the rustic character lost in modern day saison. Saisons were the original wild ales, brewed for the farmhands to be a refreshing and sustaining beverage. Each batch of Vieille takes on a soft Brettanomyces character and a complex acidity while conditioning in our large oak foeders.

Because we dose Black & Blue with real berries -- rather than artificial flavoring -- the fruit comes through in the flavor, not just the aroma.The pureed berries are added as the beer leaves the brewhouse.

The rose colored ale has aromas of ripe strawberries and grain. With flavors of fresh berries and rye, Soft Parade finishes dry and eminently drinkable.Soft Parade was originally developed because Joe Short wanted to create a beer that incorporated a medley of berries, had a great color, and appealed to wine drinkers. The name Soft Parade stemmed from two moments in Joe Short’s life. First, because Joe worked as a brewer at the Traverse Brewing Company and The Doors album, The Soft Parade, played every day at the end of the brew shift. The second moment occurred when Joe was driving by himself, flipping through CD’s in his car, and came across The Soft Parade album again. At the time, The Soft Parade beer had not been named and it dawned on Joe that the medley of fruit infusing into the golden beer reminded him of a soft parade. That day the beer was named!	"

The vessel, made of birch bark, was found in the tomb of a leather‐clad woman Dr. Pat says was probably an upper-class dancer or priestess. The analysis pointed to the ingredients used in this unique brew: wheat, lingonberries, cranberries, myrica gale, yarrow, honey and birch syrup.The base of Kvasir is a toasty red winter wheat, and the bog-grown berries deliver a pungent tartness. While a handful of hops is used, the earthy, bitter counterpunch to the sweet honey and birch syrup comes from the herbs.	"

Our destination is 9,000 years ago, in Northern China! Preserved pottery jars found in the Neolithic villiage of Jiahu, in Henan province, have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey and fruit was being produced that long ago, right around the same time that barley beer and grape wine were beginning to be made in the Middle East!Fast forward to 2005. Molecular archaeologist Dr. Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology calls on Dogfish Head to re-create another ancient beverage, and Chateau Jiahu is born.In keeping with historic evidence, Dogfish brewers use brown rice syrup, orange blossom honey, muscat grape, barley malt and hawthorn berry.

Tampa was once home to a bustling Jai Alai fronton but sadly all that remains of Jai Alai in the Tampa Bay area is this India Pale Ale that we brew in tribute to the merry game. The India Pale Ale style of beer has its roots in the ales sent from England to thirsty British troops in India during the 18th century.

Some may say there are few ways to improve Sculpin’s unique flavor, but the tart freshness of grapefruit perfectly complements our IPA’s citrusy hop character. Grapefruit’s a winter fruit, but this easy-drinking ale tastes like summer.The Sculpin IPA is a testament to our humble beginnings as Home Brew Mart. It showcases bright flavors and aromas of apricot, peach, mango & lemon. The lighter body also brings out the crispness of the hops. The Sculpin fish has poisonous spikes on its fins that can give a strong sting. Ironically, the meat from a Sculpin fish is considered some of the tastiest. Something that has a sting but tastes great; sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale. This version of our Sculpin IPA has grapefruit added; the grapefruit flavor really enhances the citrus aroma of the hops.	"

1268,Lunch,IPA - American,7.0,4.39,60.0,"Notes:Our “East Coast” version of a West Coast-style IPA. Intense hop flavors and aromas of tropical and citrus fruits and pine dominate.

1269,Fresh Squeezed IPA,IPA - American,6.4,4.26,60.0,"Notes:This mouthwateringly delicious IPA gets its flavor from a heavy helping of Citra and Mosaic hops. Don't worry, no fruit was harmed in the making of this beer.60 IBU	"
1270,Flower Power India Pale Ale,IPA - American,7.2,4.24,60.0,Notes:Enjoy the clover honey hue and tropical nose.

1271,"Smuttynose IPA ""Finest Kind""",IPA - American,6.9,4.12,60.0,"Notes:You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 75 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they’ll be quite pleased.75 IBU	"
1272,ApriHop,IPA - American,7.0,3.87,60.0,"Notes:Aprihop is an American IPA brewed with Pilsner and Crystal malts. It's massively hopped -- in the continuous fashion, of course! -- and the flavor is complemented by the addition of apricots.After fermentation, the beer is dry hopped with irresponsible amounts of Amarillo hops. The beer has a hoppy aroma, with the apricots playing a supporting role.The flavor is rich with late hop flavors, and its bitterness is tempered by just the right amount of malt sweetness and fruity undertones from the apricots.50 IBU	"
1273,Harvest Ale,IPA - American,7.6,4.26,60.0,"Notes:Each fall, our brewhouse looks more like a greenhouse as thousands of pounds of wet hop cones arrive within hours of being picked by some of our favorite local hop growers. Acting quickly, we then load up these wet hops into what will become Harvest Ale – an impossibly aromatic and bright IPA bursting with fresh pine, melon and citrus notes. Our ode to the beauty that is the wet, American hop.70 IBU	"

1289,Go To IPA,IPA - American,4.8,3.97,60.0,"Notes:A vibrant hop-bursted session IPAFirst Release: March 2014Since Day One, we've been abundantly forthright and fully transparent about our lust for hops. It's led us to craft many an IPA, most of them imperial—some intense for their time and all timeless in their intensity. For Stone Go To IPA, we embrace our hop obsession in a new way, funneling an abundance of lupulin-borne bitterness into a ""session"" IPA that delivers all the fruity, piney character of a much bigger IPA. To accomplish this, we employ ""hop bursting,"" a new technique wherein an irrational amount of hops is added during the final phase of the brewing process to coax out extreme flavors and aromas while also imparting a burst of desirably pleasant bitterness. The result is an alpha-acid-rich beer that fans can enjoy more of without missing out on the assertive hop character you, like us, crave. So, sit back and go two with your new everyday go-to IPA and bask along with us in the glory of the almighty hop.	"
1290,Anchor Liberty Ale,IPA - American,5.9,3.9,60.0,"Notes:The champagne-like bubbles, distinctive hop bouquet, and balanced character of Liberty Ale® revives centuries-old ale brewing traditions that are now more relevant than ever.	First introduced in 1975, Liberty Ale® is brewed strictly according to traditional craft brewing methods, and uses only natural ingredients — pale malted barley, fresh whole-cone Cascade hops and a special top-fermenting yeast, and water.The yeast used during fermentation produces many of Liberty Ale's subtle flavors and characteristics. A natural process called ""bunging"" creates gentle carbonation, and the practice of dry hopping (adding fresh hops to the brew during aging), revived by Anchor, creates its unique aroma.Liberty Ale® was first brewed to celebrate the bicentennial of Paul Revere’s historic ride. As the first modern American IPA brewed after prohibition and the first modern American single-hop ale and dry-hopped ale, Anchor’s Liberty Ale® is the original craft brewed ale and the historic beer that started a revolution.	"
1291,Snake Dog,IPA - American,7.1,3.59,60.0,"Notes:A potent snakebite of Citra, Mosaic, Warrior, Simcoe, and Columbus hops (more than 2lbs per barrel) gives this beer its citrus-forward superpower. Orange and tropical fruit aromas temper slightly-piney crispness, turning Snake Dog into a more complex breed of West Coast IPA. You’ll find Snake Dog bites hardest when paired with peppery cheeses, curries, and mild Thai dishes whose names you can’t pronounce properly.60 IBU	"

The idea, which Sierra Nevada hasn't fully revealed, will extract pure hop oil from mature cones, to create an IPA that smells unlike any other IPA you've had. Aroma is key.

1296,Crooked Tree IPA,IPA - American,6.5,3.99,60.0,"Notes:Inspired by West Coast I.P.A.'s, but brewed with Michigan style.

An anything-but-delicate blend of sharp hoppiness and fruity aroma, this beer is a life-changing backyard knife-fight for your palate. Once you’ve had a Raging Bitch, everything else pales in comparison. Fermented with a volcano-like Belgian yeast strain called “El Diablo,” Raging Bitch earned its polarizing name from the aggressively active nature of the yeast—unleashed, untamed, unbridled...and in heat.

1305,Accumulation,IPA - Belgian,6.2,3.74,65.0,"Notes:This winter, IBUs start accumulating like snow in Colorado with our new Accumulation White IPA. Brewing a white IPA was not only a way to salute the white beauty falling from the sky, but a direct revolt to the longstanding tradition of brewing dark beers for winter. At least that’s what our rebellious brewer Grady Hull likes to claim as he shovels in plenty of new hop varietals and a bit of wheat for a smooth mouthfeel. Stack up a few cases of Accumulation White IPA to keep your long nights glowing blizzard white.	"

At the beginning of run off, we add a portion of hops to the sweet wort in the kettle; a technique known as ""first wort hopping"". As the boil begins, a generous amount of Chinook hops are added for bittering. Later, in the whirlpool, the beer is hopped with a blend of Centennial and Amarillo, for aroma. This same blend is used, post fermentation, to lend additional hop character to the finished beer.

Brouwerij Van Steenberge uses the famous Piraat ale as the base providing the brew with a full-bodied fruity flavor from the malt blended with dry characteristics derived from the high levels of alcohol. Then, four different hops are added into the brew three times during the brewing process (hence triple hop).The hops pitched are saaz, tetra and aurora twice in the brew house and then cascade is used to dry hop. These four hop styles deliver a complex character, which stands up to the great name of Piraat."
1328,White IPA,IPA - Belgian,6.2,3.87,65.0,"Notes:Ken Hermann has taken our exploration of – and adoration for – the IPA style in a completely new direction. With notes of orange peel and coriander, the soft mouthfeel reminiscent of a Belgian wit, and the hop additions of Simcoe, Citra and Cascade, he strikes a delicate balance between two disparate styles while showcasing the characteristics of both.

1334,Tree Bucket Double IPA,IPA - Belgian,9.5,4.08,65.0,"Notes:Big, bold, and balanced, this double IPA is unlike most. We take an artistic Belgian approach to our beer. Our brewers sling some serious Citra hops into the kettle as you might expect, but we overlay that excessive hoppiness with Belgian candi sugar to add dimension to this beer. The result is a siege of hop flavor without the bitterness. Tree Bucket catapults out of the brewery once a year. Hoppy beers are not for cellaring. Find it, drink it, enjoy it now.	"

This version of Hop God is a fascinating, big, bold Belgian-style Tripel hopped in very high amounts to concentrate citrus, grapefruit and floral aromatics in the nose.

1337,Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster,IPA - Belgian,10.2,4.11,65.0,"Notes:Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is a Belgian-style Double IPA brewed with Australian Galaxy hops.

Brewed with rich malt, noble hops, Trappist yeast and a kick of coriander, this is one complex beer. Rather than make a beer that's more of a dare to drink than a pleasure, balance was the priority here. We wanted a beer for ""hop heads"" and novices alike.

1350,Aldebaran,IPA - Belgian,10.25,3.96,65.0,"Notes:A very hoppy citrus nose leads this beer, with low malt and high hops in flavor. The Belgian yeast leaves the palate creamy instead of dry. This is an awe-some beer for Belgian and hop fans alike.	"
1351,NightTime,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,8.2,4.12,60.0,"Notes:Kinda like Daytime's big, dark and scary sidekick, this ale is packed full of highly roasted malts then bitterly balanced with fistfuls of the dankest hops. Not for the lunch crowd or the faint of heart.	"
1352,Dark Penance,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,8.9,4.06,60.0,"Notes:A heavy malt foundation includes Crystal malt for sweetness and just enough Midnight Wheat malt to push the color to black. The bitterness is huge, but balanced by malt sweetness and alcohol burn. The hop flavors and aromas range from citrus to floral to pine thanks to a delicious blend of hand-selected Chinook and Centennial hops.100 IBUs	"

1356,Snow Day Winter Ale,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,6.2,3.7,60.0,"Notes:Pleasantly hoppy, Snow Day carries the subtle chocolate and caramel flavors of a new brewing malt known as Midnight Wheat. The Styrian Golding, Centennial and Cascade hops bring the backbone of hoppy bitterness to complement the roasty undertones. This beer is the deep garnet of a roasted walnut and presents a creamy tan head, floating artfully atop. Snow Day is bold and hoppy, drinkable and strong.	"

1359,Reserve Special Black Ale,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,7.5,3.96,60.0,"Notes:Conceived in a dimly lit room on a blistery cold night in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, but born and raised here in Marshall Michigan. The Reserve Special is the oldest of all beers in the Dark Horse family. It has an incredibly “thick” presence and when poured into a glass its color is so dark it’s eerie. The flavors explode onto your taste buds with heavy malt, roast, and chocolate, but stay very balanced. The Reserve Special Black Ale has a hard time being called a stout or porter but it fits nicely into the category of a delicious strong black ale.	"

In the glass, dark and turbulent clouds gather. A high-pressure system of pungent hops collides with a stationary front of barley, wheat, and rye. The forecast: a veritable monsoon of flavor, with surges of roasty malt, microbursts of hops, and a chance of golfball-sized hail. The extended outlook calls for unseasonably pleasant enjoyment.65 IBU	"

1369,Death Hoppy Black Ale,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,7.0,3.87,60.0,"Notes:Formerly Death Of A Contract BrewerDeath seems so obvious: the end of life, no mas, kaput. But Humans stand an optimistic animal. Many traditions suggest alternate endings: Resurrection, reincarnation, rebirth, afterlife. Even the atheist view of Eternal Oblivion doesn't seem quite final, more of a shift in spiritual states of (un)consciousness. As usual, Jewish tradition prescribes... Food. 7 days of family, community, and bagels (beer!), called, Shiva, meaning ""7"" in Hebrew. The flip side to the 7 days of Creation with the 7th as a holy day of rest. The first meal of Shiva is ""the comfort meal."" And the number 7 provides powerful mojo: 7 Jewish wedding blessings, 7 Liberal Arts, 7 Lucky Japanese gods, 7 stars of the Big Dipper, 7 colors of the rainbow, 7 seas, 007 license to kill, 7 dwarves, We are 7 by Wordsworth with a child's view of death, 7 deadly sins, Best of 7 finals in NBA, NHL, MLB, 7th Inning stretch, no. 7 on Elway & Tiny Archibald.

The 7 Award however must go to the immortal George Carlin for 7 Dirty Words, inspired by another hero Lenny Bruce.

1370,Toxic Sludge,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,7.0,3.73,60.0,"Notes:While birds of a feather stick together, their wings should not. We blew our cap seeing images of oilslick seabirds and thinking about what may happen to more of our fine, feathered-friends as they migrate south this fall, so we hatched this flighty idea for a specialty brew called 'Toxic Sludge'.All of the proceeds will benefit Tri-State Bird Rescue & Research's ""Spreading Our Wings"" campaign and their efforts to build a Wildlife Response Annex.

Hill Farmstead Brewery rests upon the land that was once home to him and his four siblings. In his honor, this Black Ale is dutifully crafted from American and German malted barley, American hops, our ale yeast, and water from James’ well.

1375,Libertine Black Ale,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,7.2,3.96,60.0,"Notes:Lose yourself in this voluptuous beast of a beer. A twenty-first century hop overdose. This mother will seduce you, ravish you and you’ll be back gagging for more. Adore it. Lust for it. Fall for it. Libertine Black Ale is a dark hop bomb combining the hop awesomeness of an IPA, the decadent and indulgent malt flavours of a stout with an insatiable drinkability that belies the punch that this beer packs. A Dark Knight amongst pale knaves. Taste the hops, live the dream. Learn to speak beer, love fruit and never forget you come from a long line of truth seekers, dreamers and warriors… the outlaw elite. Ride toward anarchy and caramel craziness.

1379,Jukebox-Hero,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,7.5,3.98,60.0,"Notes:Our black IPA is bursting with crisp, clean bitterness and layers of wonderful American hop character. Pale Ale, Munich and Naked Golden Oats give a toasty malt backbone with a smooth mouthfeel. The dark ominous color comes from the Chocolate Malt and the de-husked highly roasted malt. We want the layers of hops to shine against this roasty malt backdrop. Warrior, Citra, Chinook, Centennial and Amarillo lend bitterness as well as a wonderful cornucopia of aromas and flavors of fresh citrus fruit, pine, fresh cut mint and fresh flowers they offer.75 IBU	"

1384,B-Craft Black,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,8.5,3.88,60.0,"Notes:Massive in every way, B-Craft delivers a complex bundle of flavors with citrus-hop aroma. Moving beyond the massive hop aroma, rich roasted malt flavors of coffee and chocolate move forward only to be checked by an impressive hop bitterness. Texture and flavor dance together so seamlessly that you may need to remind yourself that, while it drinks like a session, it delivers like an assassin.	"

1389,Epitome,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,10.3,4.29,60.0,"Notes:We don't have many rules at Carton Brewing and those we have we made up for ourselves. In general though, we strive for drinkability through balance and harmonization of flavors. But even self-imposed rules are meant to be broken. With Epitome we decided to embrace the teenage metalhead in each of us and get discordant with a seriously hoppy, high gravity, black ale. The only notions accepted were to make it bigger, bolder, hotter & faster. A Beast. The ABV had to push past 10, the black had to be ""none more,"" and the hops had to be American and piled on like a double bass drum kicking faster and harder. Drink Epitome because things worth doing are worth over doing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXRy7uocSG8&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg "
1390,Route Of All Evil Black Ale,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,7.5,3.68,60.0,"Notes:A hefty Black Ale with profound malt and hop complexity. Neither Stout nor Porter, it will be its own thing – full-bodied, bold and black. Flavor characteristics of dark chocolate, mocha, molasses and dark fruits. Balanced by piney citrusy notes of Pacific Northwest hops. Full-bodied and uncommonly satisfying at 7.5% alcohol.	"

You want to squirrel away a couple x-tra pales and head to yoga? No problem, Namaste. But, there are times when fleshy black beer is the only thing that offers the necessary weight. Visiting your uncle’s machine shop to thread some pipe before hitting a dirt track sprint car race….? You might want to digest some Lead Feather Black Ale.The might of big malts and rival hop use give Lead Feather capital dark properties. 6% ABV gives you time, but not at the expense of content.	"
1392,Black Perle Dark India Pale Ale,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,9.5,3.85,60.0,"Notes:The first release in the ""Ales from the Dark Side"" series...A dark, roasted twist on the traditional IPA that uses an absurd amount of malt and is ""octo-hopped"" with the German Perle hop. The biggest beer in the RJ Rockers linup to date.	"
1393,Dark Vine Black India Pale Ale,IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale,9.5,3.91,60.0,"Notes:A hoppy black IPA bursting with so much flavor that you might think you’re tasting double. Intensely floral nose, surprisingly light body, and strong bitter finish.	"

Brewed and fermented with almost no residual sugars, a generous amounts of Chinook hops impart clean, citrus flavors with a moderately low bitterness. As “Brut” is the sparkling wine designation for being very dry, this IPA’s main attraction is the nice, dry finish that is perfectly balanced by fruity esters and a crisp malt backbone.28 IBU	"
1409,Moral Panic,IPA - Brut,5.75,3.92,30.0,"Notes:Huge tropical hop aromatics with an exceptionally dry finish.

1415,Rouge,IPA - Brut,7.5,3.79,30.0,"Notes:We don't joke about beer. So while many thought it was an April Fool's joke when we announced Rouge, a Brut IPA blended with Pinot Noir juice and dedicated to typos, we knew it was real and it was spectacular. The label is an anagram of our name: Rogue. And it's been the most common misspelling of our brand since day one.We can't count the times we've received phone calls for a ""Rouge Alés"" and we relish the opportunity to recount that one time our brewer's yeast was accidentally delivered to the gentleman's lounge, Club Rouge in Portland instead of Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery. Heck, we've even been guilty of misspelling our own name once or twice. It's such a common gaffe, we've even given it a term: ""getting rouged.""After 30 years of ""getting Rouged,"" we felt it was time to embrace our rougey roots and brew something delicious in honor of it.Rogue Innovation Brewer Michael King started with a brut IPA, a dry but aromatic example of the IPA style, combining 2-Row Malt, Corn Flakes and Rolled Oats. For hops, he selected Mosaic, Chinook, El Dorado, Strata, Rogue Farms Alluvial. He of course used our proprietary Pacman Yeast and Newport's own Free Range Coastal Water. And for a real Rogue (Rouge?) twist on it all, he blended it with Oregon Pinot Noir juice.The result is a crisp and semi-dry brut IPA co-fermented with Oregon Pinot Noir juice for a unique flavor and an added rouge hue. The finish is hoppy and delicious.	"

1423,Black Tie Optional,IPA - Brut,6.4,4.06,30.0,"Notes:Brut IPA brewed Amarillo, Cascade, and Citra with a ridiculous amount of Peach and Blood Orange. Inspired by brunch cocktails like Bellinis and Mimosas, we brewed it with a simple malt bill of pilsner and added flaked rice to lighten the body and add a subtle coconut creaminess to the flavor. We added a small amount of cascade to the whirlpool, then fermented on over 2lbs per gallon of peaches and ½ lbs per gallon of blood oranges. Black Tie Optional fermented to 0 degrees Plato for an extremely dry finish that really allows all that fruit to shine. We dry-hopped with Amarillo and Citra to compliment the fruit and tie all the flavors together.	"

Towards the end of fermentation we added over 2lbs per gallon of Raspberries and Strawberries to the fermenter, then dry-hopped with more Belma hops. Black Tie Required is big on raspberries and strawberry flavor from the large dose of fruit and accentuated by strawberry, citrus character of the Belma hop, but drinks dry and slightly tart from the low final gravity and acidity of the fruit.

1452,IPA,IPA - English,5.9,3.64,47.5,"Notes:We started brewing this beer as a summer seasonal in 1993. There were some great IPAs out in the Pacific Northwest, but no local IPAs on the east coast. We wanted to have a local IPA, so we brewed one. People absolutely loved it, and so did we. So we made it a year-round beer, and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship.Since its introduction, Harpoon IPA has remained unique in its ability to balance hop bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Dry-hopped with Cascade hops, it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast, those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.42 IBU	"

1454,East India Pale Ale,IPA - English,6.9,3.65,47.5,"Notes:Plenty of IPAs will promise you the moon and the stars, looking to seduce you with words of smashing bitterness and hops everlasting. Actually, we're not here to ""blow you away with a lupulin cannon,"" or ""peel the enamel off your teeth."" East IPA is a clean, drinkable IPA that's packed with flavor and offers a bold balance, not a smack in the head. American hops soar in the bright piney aroma, while East Kent Goldings hops bring the taste of stone fruits and firm bitterness from IPA's ancestral British home. Give our East IPA a try with some rich crab cakes or salmon, strike up a conversation with farmhouse cheddars, and find harmony alongside spicy dishes.

Selected specifically because of their aromatic qualities, these Pacific Northwest varieties contribute a pungent blend of grapefruit, stone fruit, and floral notes.

1505,Lagunitas Sucks,IPA - Imperial,7.85,4.35,82.5,"Notes:This sad holiday season we didn’t have the brewing capacity to make our favorite seasonal brew, the widely feared BrownShugga’ Ale. You see we had a couple of really good years (thank you very much) and so heading into this season while we are awaiting the January delivery of a new brewhouse we are jammin’ along brewing 80 barrels of IPA and PILS and such every 3 hours. A couple of months back we realized that since we can only brew a mere 60 barrels of Shugga’ every 5 hours, that we were seriously screwed. For every case of Shugga’ brewed, we’d short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It’s a drag. This year, we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It’s a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga’ this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves. There is no joy in our hearts this holiday and the best we can hope for is a quick and merciful end. F*@& us. This totally blows. Whatever. We freaking munch moldy donkey butt and we just want it to be all over... So this substitute beer is a ‘Cereal Medley’ of Barley, Rye, Wheat, and Oats….

1507,West Coast IPA,IPA - Imperial,8.1,4.24,82.5,"Notes:As craft beer pioneers, we embarked on an expedition to brew the benchmark West Coast IPA. We ventured into the unknown and struck gold, discovering a tantalizing menagerie of hops. Simcoe for tropical and grapefruit zest, Columbus for hop pungency, Centennial for pine notes, Citra for citrus zest and Cascade for floral aroma are layered throughout the brewing process.

He was referring to the complex super-critical-CO2 hop extraction equipment set up on the table in the lab across from the brewhouse. Hop extracts are for the BIG brewers, he thought - suitable only for crummy sub-standard and barely-passable industrial lagers, not the subtle and elegant craft beer made here. But wrong he was. The New Brewer does not eschew any possible inputs. In this case the mountain of extracts will replace the mountain of hop vegetative material in the kettle thus creating cleaner hop flavors and preventing the otherwise spinach-like mess of a kettle full of super-hopped wort from clogging up a pump or worse. The sensuous honey-like amber ooze was administered intravenously to the wort kettle and the sacrament was complete. Another kettle of Hop Stoopid is once again raised up and fermented on high.	"

Burton Baton sits on the wood for about a month.When enjoying the Burton Baton, you'll find an awesome blend of the citrus notes from Northwestern hops melding with woody, vanilla notes from the oak.

Pliny the Elder is our Double IPA, so we felt it was fitting to name our Triple IPA after his son. It is almost a true Triple IPA with triple the amount of hops as a regular I.P.A. That said, it is extremely difficult, time and space consuming, and very expensive to make. And that is why we don’t make it more often!

We actually took the Crooked Tree recipe and doubled all of the ingredients except the water, just the way a DOUBLE should be made. Big hops balanced with tons of malt give this beer a huge body. Although this beer is as cool as ""The Fonz"" when first purchased, it gets really mellow and smooth with some age.

As we continue to move forward in our journey it felt like the perfect time to pay homage to our beginnings. King Julius is our endeavor to marry our past with what we aspire to be in the future.

The Haze is not from yeast, but rather from an interplay of lipids from the malted oat and oils and acids which naturally occur in the hand selected Dry hops. This beer is a perfect interplay between top grade malt and hops, MI water and brewing technique which cannot be faked.Hops aren't cheap, but M-43 is worth every penny!65 IBU	"
1583,All Green Everything,IPA - New England,10.5,4.43,60.0,"Notes:A huge, but dry, triple IPA packed with Motueka, Amarillo, Citra and Mosaic.	"
1584,Ghost In The Machine,IPA - New England,8.5,4.48,60.0,"Notes:Welcome to the future.Our collective human consciousness, or Ghost in the Machine, has gained a tolerance for hops beyond what mankind has ever known before. This double India Pale Ale is the necessary outcome.100+ IBU	"
1585,Juice Machine,IPA - New England,8.2,4.71,60.0,"Notes:Juice Machine was originally devised and brewed to support our very first trip to Extreme Beer Festival in 2014. We’ve revived and tweaked the original recipe on a 30 BBL scale and brought new life and experience into the idea of an obscenely hop saturated yet juicy and delicate Double IPA. It is essentially a marriage of the King Julius malt bill with a hopping intensity schedule similar to that of Very Green. The use of Magnum, Columbus, Amarillo, Citra, and Galaxy creates perhaps our most complex drink with unapologetic flavors of tangerine, mango, lime, papaya, and grapefruit with waves of dankness. Hop burp nirvana, indeed.	"
1586,Ephraim,IPA - New England,10.0,4.6,60.0,"Notes:Ephraim (1823-1913) was our great-great grandfather; Hill Farmstead Brewery resides several hundred feet downhill from the land that he and his father settled. In his honor, this Imperial India Pale Ale is dutifully crafted from American malted barley, buckets of American hops, our ale yeast and water from our well. It is unfiltered, naturally carbonated, and double dry hopped. Intensely aromatic and saturated with resinous hop flavor, this is the ale that I dream to have shared with Ephraim. 280 Theoretical IBUPale Malt; Dextrose; Centennial, Chinook, Columbus, Simcoe, and Warrior hops, Ale Yeast, and our Well Water.	"
1587,Doubleganger,IPA - New England,8.2,4.64,60.0,"Notes:This beer was conceived with the intent to push the concept of Doppelganger to the limit of flavor and intensity. Both the kettle hopping rates and dry hopping rates were increased while keeping the base beer the same. The result is intense, but also surprising in its balance and softness. The mouthfeel is viscous and coating with flavors of overripe mango, dank citrus, and tropical fruit balanced by a sharp but pleasant finish. A treat to warm you up as a true New England winter takes hold!	"
1588,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,IPA - New England,6.2,4.5,60.0,"Notes:Our third single-hop beer brewed with 100% citra hops. Big citrus aromas with a delicate dry malt presence, juicy resinous orangey hop flavor makes this beer a treat for lovers of hoppy beer.	"
1589,Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,IPA - New England,7.2,4.46,60.0,"Notes:Same base grist as Sleeper Street IPA, but with a double dose of El Dorado in the dry hop. These El Dorado hops impart a powerful aroma of distinctive lime zest, along with notes of grapefruit juice, and a subtle woodsy earthiness. The taste is bright, floral, and citrusy hop upfront and finishes with candied lime. As with all Trillium “Street” IPA’s, Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street is dry with medium-light body and a crisp finish.MALT: American 2-row Barley, White Wheat, Dextrine, C-15HOPS: El Dorado, Columbus	"
1590,In Perpetuity,IPA - New England,6.7,4.54,60.0,"Notes:In 2014, I brewed an American Pale Ale - Beneficiaries of Chance - in celebration of marrying the love of my life, Lauren (aka Tree House L-Dog). On the eve of our first anniversary, I brewed another beer for Lauren, In Perpetuity. It hopes to celebrate foreverness - in love, passion, and regardless of circumstance - the notion that what is good and beloved will last forever. In Perpetuity is brewed with a simple malt bill and two of my favorite hops - Citra, and Nelson. It pours a hazy bright orange in the glass and mixes notes of tropical fruit with a strong citrus backbone. Soft, and eminently drinkable. I hope you enjoy it. Notes on the can design: Artist and friend Dean McKeever has created a memorable piece of artwork displaying Sand Beach in Acadia National Park at night - a magical place that everyone in New England should visit... especially at night.	"
1591,Puff,IPA - New England,9.8,4.17,60.0,"Notes:If you love Resin, try tasting it straight from the tanks. That’s Puff – a hazy, unfiltered pour straight from the tanks, with an extra dose of dry hops... a new blend devised just for Puff.	"
1592,Softly Spoken Magic Spells,IPA - New England,8.6,4.42,60.0,Notes:FAR AWAY ACROSS THE FIELD there is a golden IIPA with a tropical / bright citrus / mild pine and smooth / soft lightly sweet malt that will take you home home again.	
1593,Fiddlehead IPA,IPA - New England,6.2,4.07,60.0,"Notes:This medium bodied American style IPA has an alluring golden glow and beautifully blends three strains of hops. While strong citrus notes ambush your taste buds halfway through the palate, the beer finishes very crisp and dry.53 IBU	"
1594,Very Hazy,IPA - New England,8.6,4.75,60.0,"Notes:A kicked up version of Haze, Very Hazy is a beer that makes us Very Happy! Very Hazy conveys all the beautiful flavors of Haze, but with even greater depth and potency. Pungent grapefruit notes greet your palate while an underlying current of soft tropical fruit dances in the background. Just the right amount of bitterness balances the sweet fruit flavors while a velvety soft mouthfeel make you easily (and dangerously!) forget this one clocks in at 8.6% ABV. A huge and beautiful beer that maintains softness and delicacy - a beer we are very excited about!	"
1595,Harlan IPA,IPA - New England,6.0,4.33,60.0,Notes:Harlan is Edward’s slightly more aggressive alter-ego. Dry Hopped exclusively with Columbus hops.	
1596,Upper Case,IPA - New England,9.0,4.52,60.0,"Notes:UPPER CASE has a delicate, dry pilsner malt character with a smooth, soft, doughy mouthfeel from the raw wheat, oily hop resin which all serves as a canvas for this twice dry hopped 9% double IPA. Overripe mango, pineapple and passion fruit aromas leap out as the beer is poured. The impression of tropical fruit also takes the lead in the flavor which is layered further by white wine, pine resin and grapefruit zest. Hopped primarily with Mosaic with supporting roles played by Galaxy, Citra and Columbus.MALT: Pilsner, Flaked Wheat, C-15, Dextrine, DextroseHOPS: Mosaic, Galaxy, Citra, Columbus	"
1597,Society & Solitude #6,IPA - New England,8.1,4.52,60.0,Notes:Imperial Pale Ale brewed almost exclusively with Mosaic hops from the Pacific Northwest.	
1598,Scaled Up,IPA - New England,8.0,4.46,60.0,"Notes:The first Double IPA produced at our Canton brewery. Featuring four powerful aromatic hop varieties, Galaxy, Mosaic, Nelson Sauvin, and Columbus, Scaled Up emits dank, spicy, aromas that lead into fruity, citrusy flavors of peach and orange on the palate. Lighter in body than most of our other Double IPAs, Scaled Up finishes dry and smooth with a pleasant bitterness.MALT: Pilsner, White Wheat, Flaked Wheat, Dextrine, Dextrose, C-15HOPS: Galaxy, Mosaic, Nelson Sauvin, Columbus	"
1599,JJJuliusss,IPA - New England,6.8,4.68,60.0,"Notes:Julius Gone Wild (not funky wild, like insane hop saturation wild)! For the second special edition of Julius brewed specifically for the third anniversary party, we pushed the level of citrus to the fringes of obscenity through additional kettle and dry hopping with the base Julius hop blend. The result is perhaps the most juicy and delectable creation we have ever made! Preposterous Julius, in the best way imaginable.	"
1600,Double Dry Hopped Scaled,IPA - New England,7.0,4.44,60.0,"Notes:An intensified version of Scaled and the latest addition to our line-up of aromatic, juicy IPA's. The secondary dry hop of El Dorado and Citra results in an enhanced nose of citrus, pineapple, and wet earth. The flavor brings intense lime, refreshingly pithy bitterness and just a touch of toasted malt. Medium bodied with a dry finish. MALT: American 2-row Barley, White Wheat, Flaked Wheat, Dextrine, C-15HOPS: El Dorado, Citra, Columbus	"

We've chosen German hops for aroma, and rounded out the recipe with a blend of American and German malts.While it is very much like a pilsner, our Pale Ale is fermented at ale temperatures, giving it a subdued fruitiness--a perfect compliment to the crispness of the wheat and maltiness of the Munich malt.

Multiple additions of German Hallertauer hops are used to achieve this delicate flavor. We use a special Kölsch yeast, an ale yeast that ferments at lager temperatures, to yield the slightly fruity, clean flavor of this beer. Fancy Lawnmower Beer is a world class brew yet light enough to be enjoyed by Texans after strenuous activities, like mowing the lawn.Bronze Medal, 2006 Great American Beer Festival	"

Fermented at 62 degrees, then cold conditioned, it has the delicate fruity aroma of an ale with the crisp, clean finish of a lager. It is brewed with lightly roasted malt and 100% German Noble Hops: Perle for bitterness and Hallertau Traditional for flavor and aroma.In 1918, the term Kölsch was used to describe the ale brewed in Köln, a city on the Rhine River in western Germany. The style began to rise in popularity in the 1960s and now, many American craft brewers brew variations of the style, labeling it a golden ale. Our Kölsch is unique to the Schlafly brewery because Ulrike, a native of Köln and wife of brewery co-founder Tom Schlafly, connected Schlafly Beer with the Gaffel Brewery of Köln.

The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food.

Through extended, natural conditioning, not a hint of haze remains. An aggressive pour yields a thick and billowing head that clings to the side of the glass as you work your way through the pour. It is the most appealing looking beer we have made in recent memory. We taste mild chocolate, brown bread, hay, and earthy noble hops. It goes down remarkably easy while leaving a pleasant and lingering impression on your palate. The mark of a great beer is the ease in which it drinks in conjunction with potent, appealing, and incisive flavors. To that end, we are extraordinarily proud to offer Nomad to you for your enjoyment. I’m not sure if there is another beer we will collectively drink more of this autumn at Tree House.	"

It's lagered in century old caves underneath the historic Schlenkerla brewery and maltings. Schlenkerla Helles is boiled in the same copper kettles and bottom fermented by the same yeast as the historic Schlenkerla Smokebeer.

2520,Summer Lager,Lager - Helles,4.5,3.53,21.5,"Notes:Our Helles-Style Summer Lager is a bright, golden beer, perfect for summertime. The malts we use impart a wonderful, fresh grain character, reminiscent of European lagers. The German Noble hop, Mittelfrüh, lends a mild lemony, spicy flavor.The German word “Helles” translates as “light” and “Lager” means “to store”. This beer style emerged in Germany through the Spaten Brewery’s marriage of British, Bohemian and German brewing techniques. This style is an integral part of brewing history and a predecessor of the straw-colored, light-bodied beers which are the most widely consumed beers in the world today. The lager yeast ferments the beer more slowly and at lower temperatures; it is then stored for maturation. This results in a beer which is more smooth and drinkable. Today, many American craft brewers offer this style as a maltier and hoppier alternative to American light lagers.17 IBU	"
2521,Helles Golden Lager,Lager - Helles,4.9,3.89,21.5,"Notes:From the German word for “Bright”, our golden lager displays a floral hop aroma with a bready malt balance.

The result is an incredibly clean, yet complex, lager.20 IBU	"

Elaborada a partir de un mosto específico, en el único centro de producción de Hijos de Rivera, en A Coruña.

Excellent aromatic balance between malts and hops. Lightly floral and herbal flavors, with a moderate warm mouthfeel, and an intense hoppy bitter taste that lingers in the mouth.	"
2525,Firestone Lager,Lager - Helles,4.5,3.92,21.5,"Notes:We created our first Firestone Lager in 2000, and it proved to be well ahead of its time. Now it's back, new and improved, for those who finally want a better lager.In a craft world dominated by hoppy beers, we have gone back to basics with Firestone Lager. this is our hardest beer to make--and our easiest one to drink. Made in the classic all-malt Munich Helles style, Firestone Lager demands technical perfection from our brewing team, with a transparent canvas that would otherwise reveal the smallest flaw. Gambrinus pilsner malt establishes a crisp, dry base with a soft mouthfeel, while noble German hops provide just a whisper of bitterness. The result is an impossibly smooth and immensely drinkable beer that aims to help redefine American Lager. In the words of Brewmaster Matt Brynildson, ""Firestone Lager is made for drinking, not thinking. It's all about enjoying a good, clean beer.""	"

An homage to the days when beers were made 100% from malted barley, Gold Leaf is brewed with four European malts tempered with a touch of three imported hops. Plus, it’s got subtle bready notes. And since it’s not super hoppy or dark, this beer doesn’t hide any flavor inconsistencies. That just keeps us honest.Malts: Pilsner, Weyermann Pilsner, Vienna, Acidulated MaltHops: Northern Brewer, Saaz, TettnangIBU: 21COLOR: Gold	"
2529,Where The Helles Summer?,Lager - Helles,4.6,3.8,21.5,Notes:Where the Helles Summer? is a classic German style lager. These beers originated in the 19th century as a response to Pilsener beers from Czech brewers. Helles is German for “bright.” In the brewing world we translate it as “light” – light in color and light in alcohol. Where the Helles Summer? is a clean & bready “beer drinker’s beer” balanced with austere noble hop varieties. It’s malt-forward and forward thinking to the warmer days just ahead.

2538,Alpenflo,Lager - Helles,4.9,4.14,21.5,"Notes:Some beers are easy to make and difficult to drink… but Alpenflo is the opposite on both counts. It took years to acquire the materials and formula for Alpenflo—we’re talking all-malt, 100% 2-row barley, and we source all of the Tettnanger hops directly from family farms in Bavaria to give it that gentle spice. This lager is then cold-stored in horizontal lagering tanks to round out the flavor profile. Once opened, that frothy beverage is gone in a flash.	"

We wanted to brew something that would convey our excitement about this hop, and out of that desire, our Nelson IPL was born. By using a lighter malt base, a blend of pilsner and 2-row, and a squeaky clean German Lager yeast, this allows Nelson to show off, and rightfully so. Exploding with white wine fruitiness and gooseberry, we recruited the assistance of Wakatu and Dr. Rudi to balance the hop profile. This beer is a spotlight on New Zealand and we hope you grow just as fond of the Southern Hemisphere as we have.	"

We doubled down on the dry hop and incorporated New Zealand Motueka and German Mandarina Bavaria hops. For good measure we hit it with some Citra. We knew you wouldn’t mind. Soft and citrus-saturated hazy lager that’s an absolute crusher.Throwing an absurd amount of American hops at a classic lager seemed only natural for us. Shh, don’t tell the Germans.

An India Pale Lager (IPL) is like an IPA from a parallel universe. We use a lager strain of yeast in this beer and ferment it at a lower temperature which helps to highlight the hop flavor and aroma. We hop this beer with over two pounds per barrel of a blend of some of the most hard to get hops known as ""unicorn tears"" in the hop world. The unicorn tears mixed with rainbow shavings help make this beer highly coveted. No unicorns were harmed in the making of this beer.	"

By then it's too late, there is no going back. The hop flavor and aroma will lay you out as well as any IPA, yet has the crisp palate cleansing effects of a lager.

2589,Colorado Native IPL,Lager - India Pale Lager (IPL),6.5,3.52,50.0,"Notes:India Pale Lager brewed with 100% Colorado ingredients.We don’t believe the world needs another IPA. We do, however believe there is room for a beer that is similar to an IPA, but is one that allows the hop characters to shine through as only a lager can do... ""An IPA done better"", if you will. To get this clean, crisp character, we brewed an ""IPA style"" beer, using lager yeast. The lager yeast is superior, in this case, because it doesn’t create all of the fruity esters and fusel alcohols that ale yeast create... so it allows the delicate hop oils to shine through in the beer. Our IPL takes longer to brew and is more expensive to make than an IPA, but once you try this IPL, we think you’ll agree........ It’s worth the extra time and expense.	"

3551,Asahi Super Dry,Lager - Japanese Rice,5.0,2.77,12.0,"Notes:Asahi Super Dry was a direct result of extensive market research which indicated a consumer preference for a more palatable beer with less maltiness, relatively high alcohol content and a light aftertaste, that paired well with the changing Japanese diet. With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste. ABV 4.9-5.2% (Depends on package type and location)IBU 20SRM 4	"

The name ""Kellerbier"" has historical roots, dating back to the time when beer was still served directly from the cellar. It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.	"

895,Dunkel,Lager - Munich Dunkel,5.0,3.84,20.0,"Notes:Dunkel” means dark, and our Dunkel copies the traditional brown Munich lager that was the most widely drunk beer in Bavaria at the turn of the 20th Century. Dunkel is made from amber colored Munich malt. Germans approach dark beer from a different direction than their Belgian and British neighbors. Instead of using a small amount of high-color, dark-roasted or caramelized malt, Germans use a lot of low or medium color malt that avoids the acrid bitter roastiness or burnt sugar flavors found in stouts and porters. Dunkel is a medium -bodied beer with a slightly sweet, toasted bread crust malt flavor and smooth finish accentuated with just enough noble bitterness to balance the malt.18 IBU	"

Served unfiltered with its natural haziness, Schlenkerla Wheat reaches its full aroma through bottle fermentation with fine top fermenting yeast.	"

907,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),Lager - Rauchbier,5.9,4.27,25.0,"Notes:The Original Schlenkerla Lentbeer is an unfiltered smokebeer, brewed according to the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516. Bottom-fermenting yeast gives the reddish brown lentbeer a natural cloudiness. Its smokey aroma is already noticeable in the smell, combined with a fine hoppy note. In the drink the fullbodied, highly drinkable lentbeer shows its strong malty flavour, rounded up with the smokey taste and a light bitterness. Due to the nourishing yeast, the Original Schlenkerla Lentbeer has the ""Brotzeit already included"" (German word for afternoon snack).	"

928,Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen,Lager - Rauchbier,4.55,4.06,25.0,"Notes:Also known as Helles Märzen Kräusen Blend.In the world of German brewing, Kräusen refers to the intense proliferation of bubbles and foam formed during fermentation of a young or “green” beer. And Aufkräusen (literally to kräusen it up), refers to a historic brewing technique in which some green beer is added to a fully-matured lager. This is a very old and very typically German tradition, and today even English-speaking brewers refer to this technique as krausening. Krausening brings the vibrant freshness of young beer to the more refined, austere flavors of a fully-matured lager.Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen starts out as normal Helles Schlenkerla Lager and matures for months in the old rock cellars underneath the brewery. Just before filling it is blended using the before mentioned ""Kräusen"" technique with classic Märzen Rauchbier. The result is an unfiltered, bottom fermented and amber color Märzen Lager hybrid with a vibrant and slightly smoky flavor.IBU: 30	"

German doctors often recommend Schwarzbier for nursing mothers. Our Brewmaster, born in Munich, was the beneficiary of just such advice.We have taken the traditional Schwarzbier, intended to be a “session beer” with typically moderate alcohol, and almost doubled its strength to 7.6% alcohol by volume. We brewed our version with a fine balance of crystal and roasted malts and spiced it with noble hops. We fermented 5 O’Clock Shadow at cold temperatures with a select German lager yeast and cold-conditioned it for over four months to create a velvety smooth, easy drinking springtime brew.This German lager pours a deep brown, almost black color with ruby highlights.

5151,Faro,Lambic - Faro,4.5,3.72,5.0,"Notes:ABV varies slightlyLambic is one of the world's oldest beers. According to some, it is also the best, even if its characteristic acidity does not please all palates. To offset this acidity, some decided to add sugar to it. Thus faro was born. Adding sugar syrup to lambic was a revelation at the time of Bruegel. (Some even argue that without faro, Bruegel would have been deprived of inspiration and would have remained an ordinary amateur painter whose canvases couldn't even have been sold at a flea market.) Until the 19th century, faro was very prevalent in the Brussels region. Folklore there was frequently associated with it, and the divine liquid flowed like water. Then faro fell into oblivion. It was not until 1978 that our family brought it back to centre stage. Or centre Senne, as you prefer. Particularly appreciated after physical exertion, faro is not only easy to drink, it is a joy to do so.	"

Although the selected M.T. barrels exhibit sweet oak and apple cider characteristics, there is no added artificial sweetener or unfermented sugar in this beer. As a nod to contemporary Faro production, we used amber Belgian candi syrup to bottle condition, but this sugar has been allowed to fully referment in the bottle to produce carbonation, a hint of color, and subtle dried fruit and caramelized flavors.

He was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), ""Raspberry-Lambic"" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a rosé, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rosé de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.	"

5175,Kriek,Lambic - Fruit,3.5,3.89,18.0,"Notes:Also known as Kriek FoudroyanteWe've already told you that our family never does anything the way other people do. Kriek Lindemans is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU	"

The kriek lambic is then blended again with more young lambic to obtain a minimum intensity of 35% fruit, and is bottled immediately afterwards. These bottles are then stored in our cellars for at least five months so that the kriek lambic can develop into a beautiful, traditional, and refined Oude Kriek. With a pleasant tartness and organic notes of almond and cinnamon as it warms in the glass, 3 Fonteinen Oude Kriek, will age perfectly but may lose some of the vibrant red colours and forest fruit aromas.

5198,Oude Kriek Cuvée René,Lambic - Fruit,7.0,4.17,18.0,"Notes:Formerly known as Lindemans Kriek Cuvée René5-7% ABVThis is the masterpiece of which I am most proud, as is one of my sons after whom it is named. What makes this traditional kriek special is that it is brewed with whole cherries. Since real Schaerbeek cherries are scarce, Lindemans Brewery has found their perfect equivalence elsewhere in Europe. It is deep red in colour and its foam head is slightly pink. Very refreshing, this beverage is a perfect thirst-quencher which, thanks to its fizzy and tangy flavour, is ideal as an aperitif.In order to produce the Oude Kriek Cuvée René, the cherries ferment in lambic that is at least six months old in huge 10,000-litre oak barrels called foudres. After six months, this traditional kriek is bottled in corked 75 cl bottles. The beer will then undergo a spontaneous second fermentation process which, after a few months, will produce the carbon dioxide (CO2) to which this authentic beer owes its carbonation and distinctive foam head.

It is then bottled in a beautiful champagne bottle where a second fermentation takes place. After 6 months, the gueuze obtains a golden colour and is slightly carbonated and tart. But kept in a cellar for a few years, it becomes truly exceptional!The use of a champagne bottle dates back to an uncertain time period when lambic brewers specialized in recovering empty bottles from great restaurants and other establishments where a lot of champagne was consumed. That is why we chose the most noble of bottles to hold our noblest beer.	"

The name ""Golden Blend"" is not far away from the truth, in fact, the 4 years of maturation in oak-wooden barrels is making this particular Lambic very expensive.

Spontaneous fermentation, patient maturation in oak barrels, and continued evolution in the bottle result in a distinctively complex beer. No two bottlings are alike, as there are multiple variables in the blending process, a variety of barrel sizes and shapes, differences in aged lambic proportions, etc. This cuvée, like all of our lambic, is 100% natural, authentic, spontaneously fermented, and crafted with steadfast adherence to tradition, like Armand and Gaston Debelder have always done it. This geuze has fermented in the bottle and will continue to develop its tastes and aromas over its long life when properly cellared.

5237,Gueuze,Lambic - Gueuze,5.0,3.64,5.0,"Notes:From the brewery:There are several stories to explain the origin of the term 'gueuze'. This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze. Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuvée René.	"

This solution provides a way to keep keg pressure down and still produce a “keg conditioned” Geuze with a full-bodied taste and signature Geuze Boon sour fruitiness.

5265,Iris,Lambic - Traditional,6.5,4.37,5.0,"Notes:It is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.	"

Lasting and sapid in the mouth with a sour finish that always makes the lovers of this blend smile.This beer could very well make you develop an addiction for spontaneous fermentation and turn your entire world upside down! After a mechanical breakdown, 3 Fonteinen Brewery of Beersel (possibly the best Lambic blender in the world) had economic damage in the summer of 2009. The news caused such a stir in the International beer movement that I called Armand to know how things were. As he needed to sell his Lambic, I immediately got inspired to blend our New Morning with his beer. We selected three 18 month old Lambic barrels that we siphoned in a small tank on our truck. The journey back was long and hard, myself and Manuel took turns driving through Belgium, France and Italy only stopping for gas. After days hand bottling and months of maturation, the outcome has gone over and beyond our expectations and we can say with pride that it was worth it! 14°	"

2030,Invasion,Pale Ale - American,5.0,3.93,37.5,"Notes:The people of Tampa Bay have fallen prey to Pirate invasion every year for well over 100 years. After more than a century of failing to repel these seafaring raiders in their anachronistic wooden ships, despite access to modern sea, land and air arsenals that ostensibly should make short work of wind powered vessels equipped with naught but cast iron cannons and raging scurvy, it occurred to the folks of Cigar City Brewing that if you can’t beat them start saying Arrrr Matey! And so we have brewed Invasion Pale Ale. With tropical notes of mango and tangerine imparted by Simcoe and Mosaic hops, this crisp and sessionable Pale Ale is a perfect companion for long days of marauding, pillaging, and pirating.	"
2031,CitruSinensis,Pale Ale - American,7.9,4.08,37.5,"Notes:We took some fresh Sanguinello blood oranges, juiced 'em, concentrated that juice (without heat) and threw it into a wheatier version of our New Dogtown Pale Ale. The end result? A refreshingly hopped pale-ish ale with a huge citrus burst!The man bent over his guitar, a shearsman of sorts. The day was green. They said, 'You have a blue guitar, you do not play things as they are.' The man replied, 'Things as they are / Are changed upon the blue guitar.' And they said then, 'But play, you must, a tune beyond us, yet ourselves, a tune upon the blue guitar of things exactly as they are.' He sighs, I cannot bring a world quite round, although I patch it as I can. I sing a hero's head, large eye and bearded bronze, but not a man, although I patch him as I can and reach through him almost to man. If to serenade almost to man is to miss, by that, things as they are, say it is the serenade of a man that plays a blue guitar..."" These, the words of the Conjurer-in-Chief; Wallace Stevens, describe in perfect detail the work of a brewer as he sits to write a new recipe. Perfection is the goal, to fill a desire for a perfect beer. Yet the instrument of his mind and that of the brewhouse and yeast are the fallible tools at hand. And so he patches it as he can. A little hop here, a little citrus there, a yeast to marry the two, the worty substrate of reality calling the key and time signature. The beer that comes will be the beer we drink, the beer whose story we will tell here. The brewer does what he can and imagines a world quite round. Conjurer-in-Chief Stevens concludes; ""Exceeding music must take the place of empty heaven and its hymns."" What does it all have to do with beer?	"
2032,Citra Hopped Live Pale Ale,Pale Ale - American,5.5,3.9,37.5,"Notes:Beer is made by creating a liquid rich with fermentable material. Yeast, a living organism, is added to the liquid. The yeast floats around the fermenter gobbling up soluble sugar & converting that energy into alcohol. It’s a volatile & active environment. During this time, the beer is literally alive.Citra Hopped Live is bright, refreshing & loud. We cranked this pale ale up to 11 by adding a generous amount of Citra hops. With that in mind, we wanted the label to reflect the feeling of live music. Live pairs great with toe-tapping or head-banging to your favorite band on stage.37 IBU	"

2039,A Tiny Beautiful Something,Pale Ale - American,5.5,4.04,37.5,"Notes:A tiny beautiful something showcases a new hop variety, El Dorado. We started playing around with this hop last year. We brewed a pilot batch with this hop exclusively and one with it blended with some of our other favorite Northwest varieties. In the end, we decided that the El Dorado had such a unique and interesting character on its own, so we decided to brew it as a “single hop” pale ale. The aroma and flavor offer intense candied orange and citrus zest. A touch of flaked oats provide a rounded, silky mouthfeel. And like our other hoppy offerings, tiny was brewed to finish dry and clean.	"

2051,Orval Trappist Ale,Pale Ale - Belgian,6.9,4.24,25.0,"Notes:Orval beer is a high fermentation beer. The ageing process adds a fruity note, which strikes a subtle balance between the beer’s full-bodied yet complex flavour and bitterness.The beer was first brewed in 1931 and owes its unparalleled taste to the quality of the water, the hops and the yeast used. The brewery has selected very aromatic and unique hop varieties, which hark back to the first brewmaster of Orval, who hailed from Bavaria. The beer’s aromas are very pronounced while maintaining the right level of bitterness thanks to the English method of dry hopping.The various stages of fermentation – combined fermentation with the original yeast and with wild yeast, followed by fermentation in the bottle – mean the beer must age for some time and requires numerous quality controls.	"
2052,Rare Vos Amber Ale,Pale Ale - Belgian,6.5,4.09,25.0,"Notes:Rare Vos Amber Ale is styled after the smooth, drinkable beers popular in Belgian cafés. It pours a light copper hue, contrasting beautifully with a big, creamy white head.

The profile leans toward dry fruity (yeast-affiliated), slightly fruity/hoppy with a beguiling spiciness.

Sunshine golden with a fluffy head and a veil of Belgian ale yeast, Singel’s tropical fruit esters complement its spicy hop aromatics. Delicate in body, Singel’s mellow, dry finish culminates a truly ethereal experience. Hardywood Singel's stylistic inspiration originates with the Trappist brewers of western Europe, who are often celebrated for their gloriously complex dubbels and tripels, and whose devotion to crafting heavenly libations is second to none. Unknown to many, some of the Trappist brewers also brew a milder ale for daily consumption within the walls of the monastery. Hardywood Singel is our interpretation of this style.30 IBU	"

Winemakers, cellar workers, and grape pickers alike rarely (if ever) reach for a nice big glass of red wine in the middle of harvest.

2116,Pale Ale,Pale Ale - English,4.4,3.61,30.0,"Notes:Our flagship Pale Ale is a smooth, balanced, copper-colored session beer with mildly spiced flavor and aroma from the East Kent Goldings hops. The bready, lightly caramel malt complements the hint of fruitiness contributed by the London Ale yeast, making it satisfying and authentic; the perfect flagship beer for Schlafly.Sixteenth century brewers created amber beers by using a form of coal called coke to roast their grains. Coke burns hotter and more steadily than wood without imparting the foul odors from coal. It allowed brewers to produce caramel malts that were paler alternatives to the common brown porters. At about the same time, Flemish migrants introduced hops to English beers and soon this ale became the chosen style of England from the mid-16th century until the end of the 20th century. Today, brewers outside England have adopted the Pale Ale and made it one of the leading styles of the American craft beer movement.25 IBU	"

2812,Pilsner,Pilsner - German,5.1,3.67,32.5,"Notes:Brooklyn Pilsner is a refreshing golden lager beer, brewed in the style favored by New York’s pre-prohibition brewers. In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.	"

3100,Ship Wreck,Porter - Imperial,10.0,4.24,42.5,"Notes:Aged 1 year in Brinley Rum barrels.Shipwreck PorterBarrel Aged PorterABV: 10% | IBU: 26 | SRM: 42When our friends and neighbors at Brinley shipped us ten of the barrels used to make their Brinley Gold Shipwreck Rum from their distillery on St. Kitts, we were given the opportunity to create a beer that would take advantage of wood rather than the other way around. We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel's soul and a brew's potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck's old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar. Drink Shipwreck Porter because a barrel should be so much more than a depth charge.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRNXQnMTAg&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg "

3161,The Big Smoke,Porter - Smoked,6.2,3.88,30.0,"Notes:Now what is this? A smoked beer?? It really isn't as crazy as it sounds. 250 years ago virtually all beers were smoked (it's true, Google it!), but with the dawning of the industrial revolution most of the smoke lifted. However, in the German town of Bamberg the flame has quite literally been kept alive and to this day the town’s brewers produce world renowned beers brewed with their own special rauchmalz (beechwood smoked malt).We’ve taken our best porter recipe and added a good measure of that same Bamberg Rauchmalz. The smoke mingles beautifully with the rich, dark roasted chocolate flavours of the porter without being overpowering. Although it pairs extremely well with smoked seafood, barbeques, strong cheeses and hearty stews, its food friendliness isn’t limited to savouries; chocolate and caramel based deserts are great companions too! Trust us; it really isn't as crazy as it sounds.40 IBU	"

3170,Bourbon Barrel Vanilla Smoked Porter,Porter - Smoked,8.9,4.19,30.0,"Notes:During the summer of 2017, our brewers were developing, and subsequently falling in love with, our Ommegang Smoked Porter. Sampling the first pilot batches, it was clear that this was a beer that was meant for barrel ageing. Thus, when we brewed Smoked Porter to release in the winter of 2017, we also set some aside in bourbon barrels. Each individual barrel then received additions of several whole Madagascar vanilla beans to impart their rich and creamy flavors into the beer as it aged. Now, six months later, it is ready to drink.

Pounds of pumpkin form a malty foundation that supports the fall flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove.While pumpkin beers were produced in the early days of the American colonies, they were different from the pumpkin beers we know today. Colonists used pumpkin and squash as the fermenting medium, since malted barley was scarce. Once malt became more readily available, it replaced these alternatives to grain. In the 1990’s, American craft brewers reintroduced the style to the delight of pumpkin beer drinkers.16 IBU	"
3658,Post Road Pumpkin Ale,Pumpkin Beer,5.0,3.5,37.5,"Notes:Early American colonialists, seeking natural ingredients for brewing ales, turned to pumpkins, which were plentiful, flavorful and nutritious. Blended with barley malt, pumpkins became a commonly used beer ingredient. Post Road Pumpkin Ale brings back this tasty tradition. Hundreds of pounds of pumpkins are blended into the mash of each batch, creating a beer with an orange amber color, warm pumpkin aroma, biscuity malt center, and crisp finish.	"
3659,Pumpkin Ale,Pumpkin Beer,5.9,3.71,37.5,"Notes:Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale is our homage to the craft and heritage of America’s brewers. Recipes calling for the use of pumpkins in beer date back to early colonial times, when brewers sought to extend their supply of costly imported malt with locally grown ingredients, such as squash and “pompions.”In that spirit, we brew our ale with the addition of pumpkin to the mash, along with traditional spices to create a delicious American original.45 IBU	"

The caramel and toffee maltiness of our Piper Down Scottish ale is the perfect backdrop for a boatload of roasted pumpkin.

3693,Maple MistressSaucony Creek Brewing Company + Gastropub,Pumpkin Beer,9.5,3.96,37.5,"Notes:In the autumn of 1720, Captain Jack Rachman and his pirate-mates were celebrating their victories in typical hard-drinking tradition. Suddenly a British Navy sloop surprised them. The drunken pirates hid below deck, leaving Captain Jack’s mistresses Anne Bonney and Mary Read to defend the ship. The women shared a reputation as “fierce hell cats,” but the British Navy eventually overtook the pirate ship. Captain Jack and the pirates were sentenced to hang. Anne visited her lover in his cell before his execution, and instead of loving words her scathing comments live on throughout history, “Had you fought like a man, you need not have been hang’d like a dog.” Their legacy inspired us to brew an equally ferocious Imperial Pumpkin Ale brewed with pirate rum spices. We added a touch of autumn flavor with roasted butternut squash and natural maple syrup.	"

Cherry chestnut in color, it's opaque but not cloudy with full carbonation topped by a smooth, tan head. Flavors and aromas of roasted malt, molasses and brown sugar, dark fruits, brandied raisins and chocolate, Three Philosophers has notable sweetness with low hop bitterness. The mid-palate shows a soft malt center which gives way to a dry, warm, wine-like finish.The complexity of this beer make it a good candidate for ageing gracefully, as spicy sherry and port notes should intensify.

Like the other Westvleteren beers, the bottle does not have a label, and the cap therefore has all the required information.The Westvleteren 12 has always been rated high on beer reviews, and is by some considered to be the best beer in the world.Just as the other Westvleteren beers, it can only legally be purchased at the monestary (on appointment) or in the bar across the street.

Better known for stories such as The Little Mermaid, Andersen wrote this short, cautionary tale for a somewhat older audience. Our quadrupel ale, also meant for the mature connoisseur, is a deep and mysterious libation, dark auburn and full-bodied, its sweetness deceptive.

4356,Stickee Monkee,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5,4.49,37.5,"Notes:It has been said that the only constant is change and the same is true for barrel-aged beers. Cut from a similar recipe, this barrel-aged Quad evolves and shows a different face each year; a result of time spent aging in the barrel. Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico adds wonderful molasses flavors that are reminiscent of Belgian candi sugar. It has a full body and lush texture with barrel expression all over; toasted oak, coconut, leather and rich cigar tobacco.	"
4357,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),Quadrupel (Quad),11.2,4.28,37.5,"Notes:Based loosely on the Smokestack Series’ The Sixth Glass, this abbey-style quadrupel is separated into a number of oak bourbon barrels where it ages for varying lengths of time, some for up to three years. Cherries are added to make up for the “angel's share” of beer lost during barrel aging. Selected barrels are then blended for optimum flavor. The resulting beer retains only very subtle cherry characteristics, with toffee and vanilla notes coming to the fore.19 IBU	"

Given its dark colour and 10.5% alcohol content (a first for Unibroue), we knew that this Belgian quadruple-style ale might very well be greeted with reticence.So we gave it a name that would evoke terror and worry, but also something extraordinary, formidable and awe-inspiring.

Judgment Day is the base beer for our Cuvee de Tomme. Many of the Trappist Breweries produce a version of beer which ages incredibly well for many years to come. And, since none of us knows when the end of the world is coming, we suggest you stock up with lots of Lost Abbey beers so that when the end of the world magically appears from no where, you’ll have a beer or two on hand for even the stingiest of angels.

So we thought it might be interesting to take the base beer for Cuvee de Tomme age in first fill Bourbon Barrels and let mother nature take over. Of course, because this is a Rock and Roll inspired Box Set beer, we couldn’t just leave well enough alone.Upon sampling the base beer, it became apparent that the raisins used to brew the base beer were going to drive the flavor bus of this beer. The conversations turned to Oatmeal Raisin cookies and the essence of a freshly baked treat. So we added some cinnamon sticks to the barrels and threw in some dried chiles as well.	"
4374,Rigor Mortis Abt,Quadrupel (Quad),10.5,3.99,37.5,"Notes:Strong brown ale inspired by the beer brewed by Belgian Trappist monks. Very little bitterness, this beer has intense malty and sweet flavours, mixed with the taste of chocolate and caramel. It presents complex red fruit and spice flavours due to the type of yeast that is used during the brewing process. This beer is at its best only after it has aged for six months. The Rigor Mortis are complex beers designed and brewed with patience and care in the tradition of the great Belgian Abbey beers.	"

Quadrupel can be conserved for many years, and is a real treat for true ale enthusiasts.

Its malt-forward profile yields to a warm finish. The recipe development phase of this Quad stretched over three years and 13 experimental brews. The Spencer monks sought an alternative to the use of spices for flavor enhancement by pushing the boundaries of traditional Trappist Quad malt profiles, even incorporating some local barley grown in nearby Barre, MA which was craft malted in Hadley, MA.

4400,Three Philosophers - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Quadrupel (Quad),12.3,4.15,37.5,"Notes:We have a new twist on an old favorite coming out in February. Our unique Three Philosophers Quardupel Ale is universally-known as the preferred elixir of life’s meditators, thinkers and theorizers. Now, thanks to Brewmaster Phil Leinhart and the 24 bourbon barrels he got his hands on, mullers of life’s mysteries can ponder all the more deeply. “We’ve experimented with barrel aging in the past and had great success,” said Brewmaster Phil Leinhart. “Three Philosophers is such a lovely, complex beer and it ages so beautifully that we thought it the perfect fit for pairing with bourbon barrels. The result is exactly what we hoped for: even more complex flavors and a slightly fuller body than the standard. We’re sure this’ll be a crowd pleaser.”Like the original, Bourbon Barrel-aged Three Philosophers pours a deep burgundy hue with a fluffy, off-white head. Patience through the aging process rewarded the brewers with flavors of caramel, raisin, dried fruit, molasses, and vanilla and aromas of oak, vanilla, and subtle hints of cherry. The body is ample but still finishes faintly dry with lingering hints of malt, bourbon, and cherry. The effects of barrel-aging, eliciting remnant alcohol from the cooperage during the aging process, escalated the ABV of the beer from 9.7% to a significant, yet sneakily subtle, 11.4% ABV.ABV varies by batch	"

While those in the know favor the third pronunciation, no matter how you say it, this is a unique red IPA. The beer was first brewed in September 2015 to support music and arts education programs in Pataskala, Ohio, where Stone co-founder Greg Koch grew up. People there loved it, so we added the beer to our seasonal lineup. The deep crimson hue is courtesy of a fairly new special German malt variety by BESTMALZ called Red X. Dry-hopped with Mosaic, Cascade and Amarillo hops, this beer is incredibly citrus-forward, rounded out with biscuit and toffee notes. We think you’ll find this red IPA to be quite deliciously satisfying, no matter how you choose to pronounce it.	"

Through its first three seasons, the critically acclaimed drama has become the biggest show on HBO.Named after the motto of House Targaryen, Fire and Blood is inspired by Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons, Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion.

2172,Red Wheelbarrow,Red Ale - American Amber / Red,7.0,4.07,35.0,"Notes:Like many of our beers, Red Wheelbarrow (which started out as a pilot batch brewed by Brewer Dan Roberts) doesn’t fit neatly into a style category — think of it as a stronger, more hop-forward interpretation of a traditional red ale. Red Wheelbarrow is not, however, a “red IPA” — there is robust malt character (think raisin and fig) on both the nose and palate that temper the abundant hop presence (think citrus fruit).	"
2173,BigLeaf Maple,Red Ale - American Amber / Red,6.0,3.59,35.0,"Notes:BigLeaf Maple Autumn Red is a quaffable, well-balanced red ale with character. Its malty complexity and coppery color come from a combination of two caramel malts, pale malt, and a hint of maple syrup. To complement these flavors, we used three additions of Nelson Sauvin hops in the brewkettle and a unique blend of Nelson Sauvin, Citra, and Cascade for dry hopping. The result is a distinctive fall seasonal with extraordinary depth and intriguing aroma.	"

Five different malts, select hop varieties, and our own specially cultivated yeast create an ale which leads with hop flavors and a subtle impression of fruit (our yeast's contribution), followed by a palate pleasing malty finish. Our own special process uses the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer, and we leave it unfiltered. The result is a satisfying brew full of flavor with a remarkably clean and smooth finish.	"
2176,Fixed Gear,Red Ale - American Amber / Red,6.8,3.74,35.0,"Notes:The energy and audacity of the fixed gear courier inspired us to create Fixed Gear, a big, bold American Red IPA. It pours a glaring crimson tone with a rocky white head and a brilliant floral-citrus aroma, thanks to an aggressive Centennial, Cascade, and Chinook dry hopping. Gratuitous amounts of dark caramel malts lend Fixed Gear its immodest, malty spine, while Chinook and Cascade hops impart its balanced citrus bite. This one’s got an attitude!The hop flavor in Fixed Gear mingles well with Indian spices like tamarind, coriander, and cardamom; try it with tandoori chicken or pork vindaloo with rice on the side.

2184,Roundhouse,Red Ale - American Amber / Red,7.5,4.02,35.0,"Notes:Substantial amounts of late-kettle hop additions and dry-hopping yields a heady blend of fruity aromas of pineapple, peach and citrus. Those aromas continue into a crisply bitter hop presence across the tongue, but the judicious use of toasted and caramel specialty malts prevents the hop intensity from overwhelming the palate.Locally sourced Michigan honey creates a smooth, dry finish that pulls everything together.The India Red Ale style is a variation on the IPA, but with more caramel and toasted malt character and a reddish hue.Roundhouse was first brewed at our original brewery in downtown Kalamazoo in 2009.

The citrus & resinous pine notes of the Pacific Northwest hop family are also well represented, making their presence known through Simcoe, Citra, and the newly released Mosaic varietal, just to name a few. A wide range of specialty malts anchor the hops to this Imperial Red Ale, contrasting the assertive bitterness & juicy aromatics with a robust, toasty depth of flavor.

Crack open The Craic and let the friendly banter, bursts of laughter, and toe-tapping music of the season get your eyes smiling.This hybrid ale combines two classic styles —IPA and Irish Red Ale—to create a unique and flavorful beer. Th­e malt combination commonly used in Irish Red Ales brings a toasted, malty flavor that balances the citrusy and fruity character of the hops.The Levels of Craic: Have you tried our new Irish Red IPA, The Craic? As we prepare for all things Irish for Harpoon St. Pat’s Fest on March 3rd and 4th, we thought it would only be right to give you a little bit more history about the phrase ‘the craic.’ Pronounced just like a drug, crack (crack is whack, btw!), it’s a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation. You’ll often hear, “What’s the Craic” in Ireland which is like saying “What’s Happening?” But perhaps our favorite part of the word ‘craic’ is that there are actually 6 levels of craic you can reach (according to IrelandCentral. Check ‘em out: Level One: Good Craic – It’s an okay night out, but nothing to write home about (we don’t know why we mentioned this because honestly, St. Pat’s Fest could never be just at level one – but … the more you know). Level Two: Mighty Craic – It’s obviously a little bit better than good craic, but we still haven’t hit the amazing level. One or two of your friends may have done something a little bit crazy. Hopefully, you caught it on Snapchat.Level Three: Savage Craic – This is getting closer to how we describe St. Pat’s. A great time with your friends; beers flowing, great bands, food, and jokes. You got a number, you gave a number, you get the idea. Level Four: Deadly Craic –This is most likely just before you hear Shipping Up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphy’s (right?). It’s just a step about savage, but not quite the pinnacle moment. Level Five: The craic was ninety – Wait, what? We’ve read that this phrase comes from a famous song by The Dubliners (get your Irish jig on), but essentially it’s the best night ever. Which is what we hope you’ll leave St. Pat’s fest saying. Level Six: Minus Craic – When a night goes terribly wrong. As employee owners, we’ve seen several of our consumers (and friends, to be honest), hit this level. Don’t be that guy! So, now that you know – what level of craic are you looking for this St. Pat’s Fest?!	"

3704,Rye-on-Rye,Rye Beer,12.0,4.25,45.0,"Notes:Why Rye? This assertively flavorful grain is more often associated with whiskey than with ales. Even in that arena, it has largely been eclipsed by corn and barley, the sources of bourbon and scotch. But when we procured some seasoned barrels from our friends at Templeton Rye, we asked ourselves, “Why not?” Why not brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellow it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks? Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Perle, Magnum, and Saphir hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish.47 IBU	"

Rye adds a spicy note while Aromatic malt adds a more subtle flavor than C-60 but increases malt aroma.• We lowered the mash rest temperature a few degrees, giving the final beer less body and more drinkability.• We jacked up the dry hopping to four times the level of Finest Kind for big hop aroma.65 IBU	"

As we all know (or should know) Chiquen refers to anything that is not chicken.Now that we have all that straight, we will talk about what is in this beer. Brewed with Maris Otter from the UK and rye malt and caramel rye from Germany, imparting a spicy, fruity and dry flavor. Then hopped with enough English Nugget and Kent Goldings just to balance and fermented with our house ale yeast. After fermentation we moved the entire batch into the AtG private dining room and into used Redemption Rye barrels from our good friends at Strong's Spirits. There it aged for 5 weeks until we felt it had picked up the right amount of residual bourbon character and oak flavors. We then transferred it to our serving tank, carbonated it and the end result is on tap now, a balanced drinkable and complex barrel aged beer.	"

This involves adding hops directly to the fermented beer in the fermenter. The hops are well supported by a large malt bill of five character malts with a generous portion of rye which contributes to mouth feel and Cameron’s Rye Pale Ale’s own special character.	"

3749,Improved Old Fashioned,Rye Beer,12.8,4.14,45.0,"Notes:Here at Brooklyn Brewery, we are, of course, beer people. But we are also “drinks people,” and many inspirations come to us out of the deep and wondrous world of cocktails. While surely invented earlier, the modern cocktail emerged in the 19th century. The original—the ur-cocktail, if you will—was the Old Fashioned. A deceptively simple drink consisting of whiskey, sugar, and bitters (stirred, not shaken), usually with a bit of citrus peel, a good Old Fashioned remains a thing of austere beauty. By the 1860s, some bartenders, Jerry Thomas (aka ""The Professor"") chief among them, became household names in America. A mixologist (believe it or not, the moniker is actually old) looking to make a name for himself would often make a change to an existing cocktail, perhaps adding absinthe, or curaçao, or a dash of maraschino liqueur. This new version would be rakishly referred to as “improved,” as the upstart barman fervently hoped to eclipse his predecessor.Well, we’ve gone this idea one better. We have “improved” the Old Fashioned by making it into a beer. Witness our strong rye beer, suffused with various spices and peels! Wonder at its long blissful rest in WhistlePig Rye Whiskey oak barrels! Marvel at its clever infusions of bitter gentian root and enticing botanicals! And then enjoy, as you are greeted by the silky spice of rye, the firm herbal bitterness, the brightness of citrus, and the sweet warmth of oak.

At the first draught, the mouth is overcome by woody, malty flavours, sustained by a discrete touch of sweetness. The aftertaste brings about the flavours of maple, which are sufficiently present to be appreciated, but never overwhelming the typical flavours of a Scotch Ale. Equinoxe du printemps is brewed only once a year in January. It is aged for two months in order to attain a perfect balance in taste. Then, it is sold starting March 21st, until stocks last.The Equinoxe du printemps was born in our Montreal brewpub in February 1999.	"

The only problem is no one makes applewood smoked wheat malt so we have to smoke it ourselves...which lengthens our brew day...so we need more beer. It's a vicious cycle of spicy hops punctuating sweet, ephemeral applewood smoke. And if you don't want to drink it, fine. We'll drink it all ourselves.	"

A low-alcohol Berliner Weisse style ale, acidified and matured in French oak puncheons for 6 months, is the foundation for this gem.

5333,Solstice D'été Aux Framboises,Sour - Berliner Weisse,5.9,4.27,4.5,"Notes:German inspired sour wheat beer. The obvious and domineering acidity of this beer is obtained by letting the unboiled wort go sour for several days. The Solstice d’Été is made complete by the addition, during the fermentation process, of a phenomenal quantity of whole fruit (raspberries or mangos or cherries) which compensate for the sourness of the beer.

5347,Snarling Badger Berliner Weisse,Sour - Berliner Weisse,7.5,3.55,4.5,"Notes:In Berliner Weisse we think we’ve found the perfect style for our summer Cellar Reserve. This north German wheat beer is traditionally brewed and released very fresh. It has a light body from the wheat and refreshingly tart acidity that make it a perfect summer thirst-quencher. Its lemony tartness is provided by a secondary fermentation with lactobacillus, the same microorganism that’s responsible for yogurt’s tang. That tartness increases and improves with age, so the people of Berlin are known to buy extra bottles to bury in their gardens for two years or more.As usual with our Cellar Reserves, we’ve taken a traditional style and added our own twist. In this case we’ve tripled the strength over the traditional beer, which should only increase its aging potential. For the primary fermentation we used a traditional Bavarian hefeweizen yeast that produces soft notes of banana and clove. We followed that with lactobacillus and six months in conditioning to create a complex fruity acidity that compliments the soft sweet malt tones and a unique ale that is both fulfilling and refreshing.15 IBU	"

5388,Grande Dame Oud Bruin,Sour - Flanders Oud Bruin,7.2,3.99,22.5,"Notes:A sour brown ale, brewed in the Flemish tradition, that rivals even the best Oud Bruins coming out of Belgium. Elegant and rustic, and full of complex flavors, berries, spice, and a hint of nuttiness, this is a great beer to share with friends on a special occasion.Born of the fortuitous encounter between a strong stout and fermented apricots from the Valais, which never reached the distillers. Our Oud Bruin (Flemish for “Old Brown”) is a rather unorthodox take on the style. It nevertheless boasts the typical sweet and sour balance between a solid malty, toffee-like, chocolaty, roasted and fruity backbone. Into this the fermented apricots merge seamlessly, with their lactic sourness, leathery and horse blanket notes from wild yeasts and a discrete touch of apricot deep down. It finally evolves harmoniously into a slightly bitter finish. Altogether a pretty unique yet very drinkable beer.	"

The wort was simmered in the kettle for 24 hours and then hopped lightly with English Kent Goldings for balance.We fermented with a Flemish blend of yeast and bacteria cultures, including lactobacillus, pediococcus, and brettanomyces. It took six months at cellar temperature for the culture to achieve the style’s characteristic quenching sourness.

About mid-July at the picking, the Northern cherries are brought in at the brewery and laid in on the base beer.Because the taste of the cherry fruit varies from year to year and this according to the number of hours of sunshine or rain, the kriekenbier at its final composition is blended with cherry beer from the year before and two-year old cherry beer.

5465,SeaQuench Ale,Sour - Gose,4.9,3.86,12.5,"Notes:SeaQuench Ale is our session sour quencher made with lime peel, black lime and sea salt. It’s a citrusy-tart union of three German styles of beer blissfully brewed into one. We begin by brewing a straightforward Kolsch with lots of wheat and Munich Malt, then we brew a salty Gose with black limes, coriander and our sea salt. We follow it all up with a citrusy-tart Berlinerweiss made with lime juice and lime peel. All three beers are then blended together in the fermentation tank to create this German hybrid.	"
5466,Troublesome,Sour - Gose,4.3,3.83,12.5,"Notes:Most brewers spend a lot of time and effort keeping lactobacillus out of their breweries; it was the first thing we brought in (it still has to stay in the corner though). We blend together two different beers to make Troublesome. The first is a somewhat uninteresting wheat beer and the second is an overly acidic & funky beer fermented solely with lactobacillus. We blend the two beers together with coriander and salt at the tail end of fermentation to create a mild, lemony tartness and a fuller sensation of mouthfeel. And yes, it's hard to make.10 IBU	"

The nose is defined by equal parts bright lactic acidity and cherry notes with a hint of coriander. On the palate, the strong lactic acidity is accentuated by the natural tartness of the cherry juice. Quantitatively, this beer is quite sweet, but we find that this level of residual sweetness is just enough to balance the acidity and that the overall perception of the beer is actually quite dry. The beer finishes very clean and in conjunction with the salt in the finish, it definitely makes you want to come back for more.pH - 3.4Total Acidity: 9.9 ml/100g	"

3947,Old School Stout,Stout - English,5.5,3.86,30.0,"Notes:When you call something ""old school"", it's usually because it's original or a classic. That is exactly why we've named this beer Old School Stout, because it's our interpretation of a classic dry stout.The word stout originally meant ""proud"" or ""brave"" but after the 14th century it took on the connotation of ""strong"". While our Old School Stout isn't exactly strong in alcohol (5.5% ABV), it is very much a rich full bodied Ale dominated by chocolate and roasted malt flavours and very well balanced. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley, just one of the six malts in our Old School Stout recipe. A subtle bitterness leads to a long creamy finish on this aphotic beauty.	"

In St. Petersburg it is difficult to “stay dry.” Our weather is either too hot and humid to avoid a constant sweat, or our tropical storms maintain a torrential downpour rolling in off the Gulf of Mexico. This beer is light in body, black in color, and packed with malt forward flavors reminiscent of chocolate, dark caramel, and coffee.	"

To this day, America’s favorite stouts are still brewed at St. James’s Gate.

Roasted barley and coffee dominate the aroma, with the sweetness from the stout balancing the acidity of the coffee. We use a unique cold toddy extraction process to brew a less acidic coffee for the beer.In the 1990’s, Kaldi’s staff started visiting the Schlafly Tap Room, asking for a pint of stout and a shot of espresso. Both Schlafly and Kaldi’s realized this was a match made in beer heaven, and soon started working together to find the perfect coffee blend to mix with our Oatmeal Stout. This collaboration continues today, with regular tastings to perfect the Coffee Stout.30 IBU	"

4080,Oatmeal Stout,Stout - Oatmeal,5.7,3.68,30.0,"Notes:Our Oatmeal Stout is a classic British-style stout brewed with flaked oatmeal and roasted barley. Freshly-roasted coffee beans, cocoa and touches of raisin and dried fruit dominate the aroma of this super dark ale. The richness of the grain blend is balanced by the nutty character of the roasted malt, the creaminess from the oatmeal flakes and a dose of hops.Before the 19th century, all barley was malted over wood-fired kilns and the resulting dark roasted malt defined the browns, porters, and stouts of England. Near the end of the 19th century, brewers had introduced oats for their purported restorative and nourishing characteristics, producing beers such as oatmeal stout and milk stout. By the 1950’s, Oatmeal Stout had nearly trickled out of existence. Following the beer’s literary rebirth in the articles of English beer writer Michael Jackson in the 1970’s, British and American craft brewers are once again promoting the style.40 IBU	"

Like the cake that inspired it, the deep red color comes from beets, which add a rich, earthy character that complements the chocolate flavor and aroma.

4104,Black Chocolate Stout,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.0,4.17,70.0,"Notes:This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. In the 18th century, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, ordered a stout to be sent to her from England. This beer was brewed strong and hoppy to survive the sea voyage, and it arrived in perfect condition. Soon ""Russian Imperial Stout"" became the toast of the Russian aristocracy. Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces.Given this beer’s higher ABV and sturdy character, we think it’s a prime candidate for cellaring. Find a cool, dry spot away from light sources, and see how it changes in the years to come. You never quite know what will happen when you age a beer: perhaps the body will smooth out, notes of vanilla, oak, and tannins will come to the front, or hints of leather and soy sauce will make themselves known. No matter what, remember that beer is meant for drinking, so don’t keep it to yourself for too long.	"

The economy was a wreck and revolt was just around the corner. Nicky the Czar dude was off playing soldier like any pale nobleman with a hemorrhagic skin condition would. Such were the final days of the old empire. Reactionary, decadent, sputnik, stroganoff, weird, and drunk. But even as the proletariat countryside labored under inhuman conditions and the threat of being sent to a futile war in the east, they wisely took the time to slam back an Imperial Stout or two. After all, life can be a real 'suka' as they said in the old country. Big, black, bourgeois, Bolshoi, belligerent, buxom, and scary.

Naturally, because of its unique fermentation with native microorganisms, the beer is different than previous versions. We’re quite happy with how it turned out, and we’re excited to release it. However, for fans of the original Black Metal, or “O.G. Black Metal” as its known, we feel as though we need to borrow the famous line from Stone Brewing Co.‘s Arrogant Bastard Ale: “You probably won’t like it.” Like all our beer, the flavors and aromas of the current batch of Black Metal are very much fermentation derived and rely far less on copious amounts of malt and hops. This is what we like to drink. We like dry, balanced, drinkable, tart beers with some interesting yeast complexity. We feel we’ve achieved this with Black Metal, and hope others enjoy it as well. There will be those that don’t, however, and wish we’d return to the days of fermenting this beer with English ale yeast, and that’s OK.	"

We took the original Chicory recipe, doubled the grain bill to hit 10% ABV, and tricked it out with all other sorts of delicious Breakfast-minded ingredients including lactose sugar (the sugar that lends Milk Stouts their character); barley malt smoked over local Fifer Orchards wood; maple syrup harvested from trees at Northfield Mount Hermon, the Western Massachusetts school where Sam and wife Mariah met; Steve’s Smokey Double Dark roast coffee from J & S Bean Factory in St. Paul Minnesota (a special nod to one of Sam’s favorite bands – The Replacements, who hail from Minnesota and wrote one of Sam’s most beloved songs: Beer for Breakfast); and for the quintessential Delaware breakfast touch – 25 pounds of Rapa Scrapple, which was added to the mash. Huge notes of coffee in the nose give way to sweet, smokey, and savory layers in the flavor which overlap bittersweet chocolate, roasty espresso, and malty undertones.

As the progenitor of its style, Arrogant Bastard Ale has reveled in its unprecedented and uncompromising celebration of intensity.

A huge malt bill and an unreasonable amount of hops make this ale one that will be appreciated by only a few, and that’s just fine with us. We didn’t brew this dark amber monster to please anyone other than ourselves.	"

We grow up thinking that the ability to become complacent is the equivalence of success in life. True Arrogant Bastards know that this could not be further from the truth. The real beauty, richness and depth in life can only be found if the journey through life itself is looked upon as a constant chance to learn, live and find life’s passion. Passion threatens the complacent, and fills them with fear. We, on the other hand, seek it out. To this end we bring you OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale. Another reward for those seeking new sources of passion, and another point of dissension for those who are not.	"

This golden beer opens with a bold blast of spicy Noble hops, courtesy of Saaz and Hallertau Mittlefruh, and gives way to the fruity aromas offered by our traditional Belgian yeast. Brewed with Pilsner and Munich malts, Trippel is classically smooth and complex, and sings with a high-note of sweet citrus before a pleasantly dry finish delivers a warm, strong boozy bite. Give Trippel a sip to get you smiling.	"

Pilsner malt combined with an Abbey yeast strain yields a remarkable and complex flavor packed with notes of spice, banana and pear. Nicely balanced, with a moderate to dry finish.Merry Monks is bottle conditioned which imparts a special effervescence to the beer and a creamier carbonation. The ongoing fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages and you’ll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures (around 55°F) and away from light.This brew is available year-round. Keep your eye out for Merry Monks in 25 oz. cork-and-cage champagne bottles for an exceptional experience!	"

The Grim Reaper better know as ""Death"" was quite found of our classic Sapient Summer Wheat Ale. When we changed it into a Belgian Style Triple, Death thought it would only be appropriate to bring something from that beer into this beer. So he picked the mailbox, and we weren’t about to argue with him. You can say what you want about him, but that Death sure has a big heart. So anyway...we brewed this beer with a Trappist yeast strain so it is very traditional. The flavors are incredibly complex with notes of mild fruit and finishes with a bit of clove. Although this beer is higher in alcohol it is very smooth and finishes dry on the palate.	"

Brother David’s Triple is brewed with copious amounts of pale malts as well as Belgian candi sugar, giving it a deep golden hue, medium body and rich mouth feel.

It has a rich aroma with a unique combination of aromatic hops, spices and the typical bouquet of fermentation – very fruity. Secondary fermentation in the bottle gives it a unique aroma due to the presence of yeast.

The bitterness comes from the Hallertau hops we use as bitterhop and as aromahop. On top of that we use dry – hopping techniques with the same hops which give the ale its unique flavour and aroma and its perfect balance between sweet and bitter. The name came from the former Guldenberg Abbey in Wevelgem, the village of birth of Nino, one of the brewers. According to data in Flandria Illustrata ale was brewed here in the past.	"

Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish. Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.19 IBU	"

4984,Hefeweizen,Wheat Beer - Hefeweizen,4.1,3.33,12.5,"Notes:Our Hefeweizen is a light, unfiltered wheat beer, often served with a wedge of lemon. Made with thirty percent American winter wheat, Hefeweizen is balanced with sweet golden malted barley and Tettnang hops from Oregon that evoke a hint of spice. The American ale yeast is subtle, but the grains take center stage and, when left in the unfiltered beer, gives it that classic cloudiness and additional body.The German Hefeweizen (say “hay-fuh-vite-sin”) traces its history to 16th century Bavaria and eventually came to America with the wave of German immigrants in the 19th century. Although the rise of light lager beer diminished the sales of wheat beers on both sides of the Atlantic, the sale of wheat beers began to rise after WWII, especially in Southern Germany where a unique ale yeast strain fermented the beer with banana and clove esters. In the late 20th Century, the new American craft brewers sought out a lighter style to complement their beer selection and brewed Hefeweizens with the same yeast strains they used to brew their Pale Ales and Stouts.16 IBU	"

4771,Devil's Heart Of Gold,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,10.0,4.22,65.0,"Notes:The name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"" comes from what they call the ""Devil’s Cut"". When a bourbon ages in a barrel, a portion of the bourbon evaporates - this is called the ""Angel’s share"". Another portion of the bourbon gets absorbed into the new oak barrel - this is called the ""Devil’s cut"". Therefore, the Heart of Gold beer aging in the barrel starts to absorb back some of the Devil’s Cut and hence the name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"". We took our Heart of Gold and aged it in a Knob Creek 9-year old barrel from our friends at The Wine and Cheese Place in October 2011. The beer rested in these barrels for 7 months. 204 bottles will be released exclusively at The Wine and Cheese Place.	"

He began with a healthy amount of Bohemian Saaz hops, and a grain bill of equal parts malted barley & wheat berries. Then he swapped the German Wizen yeast in favor of an English Ale yeast, better suited for a barley-wine. The result is a complex yet delicate beer with a soft mouthfeel which warms yet doesn’t overpower. We like to think of this beer as sort of a cross trainer between the classic unfiltered wheat style and a barley-wine ale. *(Yes he does play acoustic guitar)	"

4787,West Coast Wheat Wine,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,10.5,3.88,65.0,"Notes:Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast.Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is a heavyweight  this year (2005) tipping the scales at approximately 9.5% alcohol by volume. 50 percent of the fermentable extract is derived from malted wheat, and this lends a quenching drinkability rare to beers of this strength. This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel. The hops once again are 100% American West Coast types; this year, though, large additions of Vanguard and Sterling render the hop character softer and spicier than last years boldly citrus performance.	"
4788,Maple in the Wood,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,13.0,4.49,65.0,"Notes:When we finally opened our production facility in Maplewood in 2016, the very first guest we had visit us to brew a collaboration was Brad Clark. In 2016, we brewed a beautiful little sunset colored beer to age in French oak to be later finished on Pluots and in March of 2018, we released our first collaboration with Brad, Pitter Patter.Brad came back to town for that release, and while here, we brewed this release, Maple In The Wood - a maple bourbon and bourbon barrel-aged wheatwine. We used the flavor profiles and took inspiration from our respective barleywines, but infused the recipes with copious amounts of malted white wheat. In the kettle, we added a large percentage of Vermont maple syrup. We then aged this wheatwine in BLiS maple bourbon and E.H. Taylor bourbon barrels for 18 months before selecting a blend that showcased the barrels and the individual threads in a harmonious, cohesive way.The result is a luxurious, round, rich, beer that lays the groundwork and structure for the barrels to rest. The maple leaves a nuanced hint of sweetness that melds with the notes of bourbon, caramel, toffee, and dark fruits from the blend of yeasts we used to ferment before allowing it to age and mature in oak to softness and balance. Although it’s a big beer - like most of our barrel-aged beers - the wheat lightens the experience and allows it to fall somewhere between our Längst and Anabasis on the palate.	"

For this batch, we stepped up the spice and cider additions. Instead of 200 lbs of apples, Ben pressed 300 lbs of organic Fuji apples for a total addition of 25 gallons of fresh pressed cider, which was added to the whirlpool in order to really bring out the cider character. The amount of cilantro was nearly quadrupled with 4 lbs total, which was pureed with a portion of the cider and then added after the boil was done. The cayenne was doubled, but added directly before the beer was transferred from the kettle to the fermenter in an effort to minimize the burn while increasing the flavor and aroma contributed. A different type of wit yeast was used and then fermented slightly cooler to keep the yeast character minimal and act as a supporting role to the main players the cider and spices. Lastly, this batch was boiled for less time than the original batch, leaving the beer with a lighter straw color than the amberish hue of batch #1.Overall, Positive Contact is characterized by its bright spritzy cider character and autumnal herbal quality derived from the cilantro, cayenne, and yeast.19 IBU	"

On the one hand, it’s a revival of the classic Belgian “wit,” or “white” ale, with lactic fermentation providing a refreshing tartness. On the other hand, it’s a modern, uniquely American brew; big, flavorful, and spiced with cardamom, coriander, orange peel, lavender, and grains of paradise.15 IBU	"

5099,Citrusy Wit,Wheat Beer - Witbier,5.3,3.74,15.0,"Notes:When it comes to our beers and the ingredients we use, we give a wit. So rather than spinning just the same fruit wheel of the classic Curaçao orange peel, we punched up our wit with the dynamic duo of tangerine and kaffir lime leaf. The fruit-forward aromatics and flavors are perfectly balanced, so you don’t have to bother adding a slice (or leaf) to the rim of your glass. Even with this lack of unnecessary garnish, you won’t find an absence of intense fruit.	"
5100,Wheat Ale,Wheat Beer - Witbier,4.5,3.59,15.0,"Notes:Upland Wheat Ale is a classic rendition of the Belgian Witbier (white beer) style. We brew it with organic coriander and orange zest to be light on the tongue and refreshingly tart. In the tradition of the Belgian Wit style, Upland Wheat Ale is unfiltered, allowing suspended yeast to create a cloudy, golden appearance. This is an everyday, every meal type of beer. It’s comforting on a cold winter day and refreshing on a hot summer evening. That’s why it’s one of our most popular brews and a flagship beer of our brewery.	"

5513,Beatification,Wild Ale,6.0,4.59,17.5,"Notes:This beer is very unique and inspired by breweries in the Lambic region of Belgium and, especially, our friends at Cantillon. It is 100% spontaneously fermented, meaning yeast is not added. Once the beer is brewed, it is transferred to a cool-ship or “horny” tank located in our barrel room at the pub. There it sits overnight and collects whatever funky wild yeast and bacteria may be living in the room. The next day it is transferred to oak wine barrels where it ferments wildly and ages for a few months. The end result is a wild, spontaneously fermented, sour, and tasty hand-crafted beer!	"

5516,Tart Of Darkness,Wild Ale,7.2,4.26,17.5,"Notes:Tart of Darkness is a traditional stout that we aged in used oak barrels from The Bruery that had previously housed beers such as Cuivre™ or Black Tuesday®. We then brought them over to Bruery Terreux, added our special blend of souring bacterias and wild yeasts and watched nature take its course. The result is a perfectly tart yet awesomely dark and roasty, sour stout. Not a style you will see very often, and in our opinion, not a style seen often enough. This unique stout has notes of tart plums, roasted coffee, vanilla and oak.	"

676,Christmas Ale,Winter Warmer,8.0,3.73,42.5,"Notes:Our Christmas Ale is a warming winter ale that blends the spices of the season with sweet caramel malt. Orange peel, juniper berries, ginger root, cardamom and cloves are added for spiciness. We use honey in the fermentation process, which raises the ABV without producing too much heat from the alcohol content.Many breweries produce richer, higher alcohol beers for the winter holiday season, bolder than their year-round offerings. The inspiration for this beer came from spiced holiday beverages such as wassail and mulled wines. Around the holidays, the sweet and spicy aromas, not to mention the booze, in such libations tend to smooth the rougher edges of enjoying each other’s company and spreading goodwill.30 IBU	"
